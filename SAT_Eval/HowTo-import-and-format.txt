Steps to import and format files

1. file -> open
	NOTE: data files end in .txt, so in the "Open" dialog box you'll have to set
	the "files of type" pulldown to "All Files (*.*)" 
	
2. You should get a "Text Import Wizard" dialog box
	Step 1 of 3 - if you are bothered by weird-looking special
	characters, select "Unicode (UTF-8)" from the "File origin" pulldown.
	Hit "next"
	
	Step 2 of 3 - make sure "Tab" is chosen as the Delimiter (this is probably
	the default). Hit "next"
	
	Step 3 of 3 - This step lets you choose a format for the columns of the
	imported data. highlight the "gradeLevel" column and select the "Text"
	button for "Column data format". If you don't do this, Excel tries to format
	the grade ranges as dates. Hit "finish"
	
3. Select the "benchmark" and "text" columns, and then type Control-1 to get the
"Format Cells" dialog. choose the "Alignment" tab and then select "Wrap text"
under "Text Control". Hit OK.

4. Adjust the width of these columns to preference.

5. Select all the rows that have data in them (something like 33 of them).
Choose Format -> Row -> Autofit to get rid of extra verical space. Then, while
everything is still highlighted, hit Control-1 and from the "Alignment" tab
choose "Top" under Text Alignment, Vertical.

6. Freeze window panes so the NSES standards are always visible as you scroll the state standards. Select
the row under the NSES standards row (i.e. select row#4). Select "Window -> Freeze Panes".
