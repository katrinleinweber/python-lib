Intercomparison of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in stratiform orographic mixed-phase clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS		English	Article							FREEZING DRIZZLE FORMATION; ALPINE SITE JUNGFRAUJOCH; PREDICTION-SYSTEM SHIPS; MODEL DESCRIPTION; AIR-POLLUTION; CONDENSATION NUCLEI; ICE-NUCLEATION; DETAILED MICROPHYSICS; SOLID PRECIPITATION; KINEMATIC FRAMEWORK	Anthropogenic aerosols serve as a source of both cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) and affect microphysical properties of clouds. Increasing aerosol number concentrations is hypothesized to retard the cloud droplet coalescence and the riming in mixed-phase clouds, thereby decreasing orographic precipitation. This study presents results from a model intercomparison of 2-D simulations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in stratiform orographic mixed-phase clouds. The sensitivity of orographic precipitation to changes in the aerosol number concentrations is analysed and compared for various dynamical and thermodynamical situations. Furthermore, the sensitivities of microphysical processes such as coalescence, aggregation, riming and diffusional growth to changes in the aerosol number concentrations are evaluated and compared. The participating numerical models are the model from the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) with bulk microphysics, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with bin microphysics and the University of Wisconsin modeling system (UWNMS) with a spectral ice habit prediction microphysics scheme. All models are operated on a cloud-resolving scale with 2 km horizontal grid spacing. The results of the model intercomparison suggest that the sensitivity of orographic precipitation to aerosol modifications varies greatly from case to case and from model to model. Neither a precipitation decrease nor a precipitation increase is found robustly in all simulations. Qualitative robust results can only be found for a subset of the simulations but even then quantitative agreement is scarce. Estimates of the aerosol effect on orographic precipitation are found to range from -19% to 0% depending on the simulated case and the model. Similarly, riming is shown to decrease in some cases and models whereas it increases in others, which implies that a decrease in riming with increasing aerosol load is not a robust result. Furthermore, it is found that neither a decrease in cloud droplet coalescence nor a decrease in riming necessarily implies a decrease in precipitation due to compensation effects by other microphysical pathways. The simulations suggest that mixed-phase conditions play an important role in buffering the effect of aerosol perturbations on cloud microphysics and reducing the overall susceptibility of clouds and precipitation to changes in the aerosol number concentrations. As a consequence the aerosol effect on precipitation is suggested to be less pronounced or even inverted in regions with high terrain (e.g., the Alps or Rocky Mountains) or in regions where mixed-phase microphysics is important for the climatology of orographic precipitation.

Impact of model resolution on chemical ozone formation in Mexico City: application of the WRF-Chem model	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS		English	Article							PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; SENSITIVITY; EMISSIONS; VARIABILITY	The resolution of regional chemical/dynamical models has important effects on the calculation of the distributions of air pollutants in urban areas. In this study, the sensitivity of air pollutants and photochemical ozone production to different model resolutions is assessed by applying a regional chemical/dynamical model (version 3 of Weather Research and Forecasting Chemical model - WRF-Chemv3) to the case of Mexico City. The model results with 3, 6, 12, and 24 km resolutions are compared to local surface measurements of CO, NO(x), and O(3). The study shows that the model resolutions of 3 and 6 km provide reasonable simulations of surface CO, NO(x), and O(3) concentrations and of diurnal variations. The model tends to underestimate the measurements when the resolution is reduced to 12 km or less. The calculated surface CO, NO(x), and O(3) concentrations at 24 km resolution are significantly lower than measured values. This study suggests that the ratio of the city size to the threshold resolution is 6 to 1, and that this ratio can be considered as a test value in other urban areas for model resolution setting. There are three major factors related to the effects of model resolution on the calculations of O(3) and O(3) precursors, including; (1) the calculated meteorological conditions, (2) the spatial distribution for the emissions of ozone precursors, and (3) the non-linearity in the photochemical ozone production. Model studies suggest that, for the calculations of O(3) and O(3) precursors, spatial resolutions (resulting from different meteorological condition and transport processes) have larger impacts than the effect of the resolution associated with emission inventories. The model shows that, with coarse resolution of emission inventory (24 km) and high resolution for meteorological conditions (6 km), the calculated CO and O(3) are considerably improved compared to the results obtained with coarse resolution for both emission inventory and meteorological conditions (24 km). The resolution of the surface emissions has important effects on the calculated concentration fields, but the effects are smaller than those resulting from the model resolution. This study also suggests that the effect of model resolution on O(3) precursors leads to important impacts on the photochemical formation of ozone. This results directly from the non-linear relationship between O(3) formation and O(3) precursor concentrations. Finally, this study suggests that, considering the balance between model performance and required computation time on current computers, the 6 km resolution is an optimal resolution for the calculation of ozone and its precursors in urban areas like Mexico City.

The dynamics of unforced turbulence at high Reynolds number for Taylor-Green vortices generalized to MHD	GEOPHYSICAL AND ASTROPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS		English	Article						MHD; Turbulence; Alfven waves; Universality; Symmetries; Current sheets folding	2-DIMENSIONAL MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC TURBULENCE; CURRENT-SHEET FORMATION; MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; INCOMPRESSIBLE MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS; AVERAGED LAGRANGIANS; ALFVENIC TURBULENCE; FLUID-DYNAMICS; SOLAR-WIND; FLUCTUATIONS; FLOWS	We study decaying magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence stemming from the evolution of the Taylor-Green flow generalized recently to MHD, with equal viscosity and magnetic resistivity and up to equivalent grid resolutions of 20483 points. A pseudo-spectral code is used in which the symmetries of the velocity and magnetic fields have been implemented, allowing for sizable savings in both computer time and usage of memory at a given Reynolds number. The flow is non-helical, and at initial time the kinetic and magnetic energies are taken to be equal and concentrated in the large scales. After testing the validity of the method on grids of 5123 points, we analyze the data on the large grids up to Taylor Reynolds numbers of approximate to 2200. We find that the global temporal evolution is accelerated in MHD, compared to the corresponding neutral fluid case. We also observe an interval of time when such configurations have quasi-constant total dissipation, time during which statistical properties are determined after averaging over of the order of two turn-over times. A weak turbulence spectrum is obtained which is also given in terms of its anisotropic components. Finally, we contrast the development of small-scale eddies with two other initial conditions for the magnetic field and briefly discuss the structures that develop, and which display a complex array of current and vorticity sheets with clear rolling-up and folding.

Studies of inertio-gravity waves on midlatitude beta-plane without the traditional approximation	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY		English	Article						midlatitude Rossby beta-effect; non-traditional Coriolis effects; normal modes of oscillation	EARTHS ANGULAR VELOCITY; NONHYDROSTATIC LINEAR-MODELS; LOW FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HORIZONTAL COMPONENT; ATMOSPHERIC MODELS; DEEP ATMOSPHERES; INTERNAL WAVES; CORIOLIS-FORCE; OCEAN; ROLES	The role of the Rossby parameter beta due to the meridional variation of the Coriolis parameter f is investigated for inertio-gravity waves in midlatitudes based on a linear Boussinesq model without the traditional approximation, namely including the role of the horizontal component of the Coriolis vector of the Earth's rotation. Without the beta-effect, it is well established that the non-traditional Coriolis effects give rise to an additional mode of inertio-gravity (IG) waves whose frequencies are slightly smaller than the local Coriolis frequency f unlike the traditional IG-mode whose frequencies are larger than f. The addition of the beta-effect modifies the properties of the sub-inertial and super-inertial IG-modes. These modifications are examined by calculating the model normal modes for a given vertical profile of the buoyancy frequency N. Inclusion of the beta-effect yields the external and internal Rossby modes in addition to the IG-modes. Presence of the external Rossby mode in this model is a new result, since it does not occur in the traditional version with beta nor in the non-traditional version without beta. The normal-mode properties, including wave frequencies and eigenfunctions, are presented for various values of N. The normal-mode analysis is complemented by the initial-value approach to study the evolution of waves generated by forcing. The results of numerical time-integrations of wave generation in the ocean forced by atmospheric disturbances and by the interaction of tidal flows with bottom topography are presented to reveal a notable role of beta for the IG-waves. Application to atmospheric problems is proposed.

Toward a Transdisciplinary Environmental and Resource Sociology in China	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES		English	Review						China; environmental sociology; sociology of natural resources; transdisciplinary research	NATURAL-RESOURCE	Environmental sociology and the sociology of natural resources constitute two research traditions regarding the interactions between societies and the natural world. While discussion of the relationships between these two fields is largely restricted to the United States, their implications for developing disciplines focused on environment and society issues in other countries have seldom been addressed. In this article we introduce the dialogue between environmental sociology and the sociology of natural resources into the context of China, where environmental sociology is being established as an important academic subdiscipline. We suggest that with a transdisciplinary orientation, environmental sociology in China holds promise for integrating environmental and natural resource sociologies in responding to China's strategic goal of building a oresource-efficient and environment-friendlyo society.

Survey results demonstrate that homeowners have a fairly accurate understanding of the impact of climate change and other environmental risk factors, and that the majority have undertaken the most obvious risk mitigation investments, such as pruning vegetation around the home. Perception of climate and weather as risk factors has a significant impact on risk perception and concern about wildfire but is not a determinant of advanced mitigation effort. Further mitigation effort primarily relates to the value homeowners place on amenities associated with their house and their perception of the impact of neighboring lands mitigation.

Sensitivity of the simulated precipitation to changes in convective relaxation time scale	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE		English	Article						Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics; Precipitation	COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; CUMULUS PARAMETERIZATION; STRATIFORM PRECIPITATION; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; ADJUSTMENT SCHEME; MOIST CONVECTION; VERSION-3 CAM3; CLIMATE; FORMULATION; INTENSITY	The paper describes the sensitivity of the simulated precipitation to changes in convective relaxation time scale (TAU) of Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) cumulus parameterization, in NCAR-Community Atmosphere Model version 3 (CAM3). In the default configuration of the model, the prescribed value of TAU, a characteristic time scale with which convective available potential energy (CAPE) is removed at an exponential rate by convection, is assumed to be 1 h. However, some recent observational findings suggest that, it is larger by around one order of magnitude. In order to explore the sensitivity of the model simulation to TAU, two model frameworks have been used, namely, aqua-planet and actual-planet configurations. Numerical integrations have been carried out by using different values of TAU, and its effect on simulated precipitation has been analyzed. The aqua-planet simulations reveal that when TAU increases, rate of deep convective precipitation (DCP) decreases and this leads to an accumulation of convective instability in the atmosphere. Consequently, the moisture content in the lower-and mid-troposphere increases. On the other hand, the shallow convective precipitation (SCP) and large-scale precipitation (LSP) intensify, predominantly the SCP, and thus capping the accumulation of convective instability in the atmosphere. The total precipitation (TP) remains approximately constant, but the proportion of the three components changes significantly, which in turn alters the vertical distribution of total precipitation production. The vertical structure of moist heating changes from a vertically extended profile to a bottom heavy profile, with the increase of TAU. Altitude of the maximum vertical velocity shifts from upper troposphere to lower troposphere. Similar response was seen in the actual-planet simulations. With an increase in TAU from 1 h to 8 h, there was a significant improvement in the simulation of the seasonal mean precipitation. The fraction of deep convective precipitation was in much better agreement with satellite observations.

Meteorological and trace gas factors affecting the number concentration of atmospheric Aitken (D(p)=50 nm) particles in the continental boundary layer: parameterization using a multivariate mixed effects model	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT		English	Article							CHEMICAL-TRANSPORT MODEL; SIZE-RESOLVED AEROSOL; NUCLEATION EVENTS; OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; SULFATE AEROSOL; CENTRAL-EUROPE; SULFURIC-ACID; GROWTH; RATES; GERMANY	Measurements of aerosol size-distribution and different gas and meteorological parameters, made in three polluted sites in Central-and Southern Europe: Po Valley, Italy, Melpitz and Hohenpeissenberg in Germany, were analysed for this study to examine which of the meteorological and trace gas variables affect the number concentration of Aitken (D(p)=50 nm) particles. The aim of our study was to predict the number concentration of 50 nm particles by a combination of in-situ meteorological and gas phase parameters. The statistical model needs to describe, amongst others, the factors affecting the growth of newly formed aerosol particles (below 10 nm) to 50 nm size, but also sources of direct particle emissions in that size range. As the analysis method we used multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model. Hourly averages of gas and meteorological parameters measured at the stations were used as predictor variables; the best predictive model was attained with a combination of relative humidity, new particle formation event probability, temperature, condensation sink and concentrations of SO(2), NO(2) and ozone. The seasonal variation was also taken into account in the mixed model structure. Model simulations with the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) indicate that the parameterization can be used as a part of a larger atmospheric model to predict the concentration of climatically active particles. As an additional benefit, the introduced model framework is, in theory, applicable for any kind of measured aerosol parameter.

The multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF: model description and evaluation	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT		English	Article							CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL; RADIATION MEASUREMENT PROGRAM; SINGLE-COLUMN MODELS; CONVECTIVE CLOUDS; TRANSPORT MODELS; GLOBAL-MODELS; PART I; PARAMETERIZATION; CUMULUS; PRECIPITATION	Anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate produce one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Much of this uncertainty arises from the multi-scale nature of the interactions between aerosols, clouds and large-scale dynamics, which are difficult to represent in conventional global climate models (GCMs). In this study, we develop a multi-scale aerosol climate model that treats aerosols and clouds across different scales, and evaluate the model performance, with a focus on aerosol treatment. This new model is an extension of a multi-scale modeling framework (MMF) model that embeds a cloud-resolving model (CRM) within each grid column of a GCM. In this extension, the effects of clouds on aerosols are treated by using an explicit-cloud parameterized-pollutant (ECPP) approach that links aerosol and chemical processes on the large-scale grid with statistics of cloud properties and processes resolved by the CRM. A two-moment cloud microphysics scheme replaces the simple bulk microphysics scheme in the CRM, and a modal aerosol treatment is included in the GCM. With these extensions, this multiscale aerosol-climate model allows the explicit simulation of aerosol and chemical processes in both stratiform and convective clouds on a global scale. Simulated aerosol budgets in this new model are in the ranges of other model studies. Simulated gas and aerosol concentrations are in reasonable agreement with observations, although the model underestimates black carbon concentrations at the surface. Simulated aerosol size distributions are in reasonable agreement with observations in the marine boundary layer and in the free troposphere, while the model underestimates the accumulation mode number concentrations near the surface, and overestimates the accumulation number concentrations in the free troposphere. Simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations are within the observational variations. Simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) are in reasonable agreement with observations, and the spatial distribution of AOD is consistent with observations, while the model underestimates AOD over regions with strong fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions, and overestimates AOD over regions with strong dust emissions. Overall, this multi-scale aerosol climate model simulates aerosol fields as well as conventional aerosol models.

A dynamic probability density function treatment of cloud mass and number concentrations for low level clouds in GFDL SCM/GCM	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT		English	Article							VERTICAL-VELOCITY SKEWNESS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; PDF-BASED MODEL; PART I; SIMULATIONS; PARAMETERIZATION; STRATOCUMULUS; CONVECTION; SENSITIVITY	Successful simulation of cloud-aerosol interactions (indirect aerosol effects) in climate models requires relating grid-scale aerosol, dynamic, and thermodynamic fields to small-scale processes like aerosol activation. A turbulence and cloud parameterization, based on multivariate probability density functions (PDFs) of sub-grid vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture, has been extended to treat aerosol activation. This dynamics-PDF approach offers a solution to the problem of the scale gap between the resolution of climate models and the scales relevant for aerosol activation and a means to overcome the limitations of diagnostic estimates of cloud droplet number concentration based only on aerosol concentration. Incorporated into a single-column model for GFDL AM3, the dynamics-PDF parameterization successfully simulates cloud fraction and water content for shallow cumulus, stratocumulus, and cumulus-under-stratocumulus regimes. The extension to treat aerosol activation predicts droplet number concentrations in good agreement with large eddy simulation (LES). The dynamics-PDF droplet number concentrations match LES results more closely than state-of-the-science diagnostic relationships between aerosol concentration and droplet number concentration.
