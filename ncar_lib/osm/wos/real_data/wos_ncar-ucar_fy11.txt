Validation of Goddard Earth Observing System-version 5 MERRA planetary boundary layer heights using CALIPSO	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"This study compares the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System-version 5 (GEOS-5) model with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Part of GEOS-5 is an Atmosphere Global Circulation Model (GCM) used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Model developers are uncertain of the precision of model PBL height predictions since verification by direct observations of the PBL height is sparse. Validation of the PBL height serves as a diagnostic on whether the physics and dynamics packages are correct in the model. In this work, we report the global daytime PBL heights derived from dissertation work by Jordan (2009). We believe that this is the first large-scale observational study of PBL heights using CALIPSO. In this paper, we compare CALIPSO PBL heights to matched PBL heights from the GEOS-5 Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) model. Extensive comparisons between the model output and satellite observations in the Western Hemisphere and over Africa gave model-measurement correlation coefficients (R) of 0.47-0.73. Comparisons have been performed for regions over land and water using clouds, aerosols, and mixed cloud-aerosol features to detect the PBL. The present study provides insight of regional PBL height variances in the GEOS-5 model. For much of the study region GEOS-5 predicts PBL heights within 25% of CALIPSO observations. A case over the Equatorial Pacific indicates that the GEOS-5/CALIPSO PBL height ratios exceed 1.25. PBL height biases in the Equatorial Pacific may be related to the GCM coupling scheme implemented in GEOS-5. Also, in some regions, the CALIPSO PBL heights are generally higher than the GEOS-5 model."	0148-0227		DEC 31	2010	115							D24218	10.1029/2009JD013777

The method, designed to achieve improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy over conventional straight-line methods, takes rays' first-order bending into account to better describe curved raypaths in the stratified atmosphere. CRT is then used to simulate the phase path from GPS radio occultation (RO). The merit of the ray tracing approach in GPS RO is explicit consideration of horizontal variation in the atmosphere, which may lead to a sizable error but is disregarded in traditional retrieval schemes. In addition, direct modeling of the phase path takes advantage of simple error characteristics in the measurement. With provision of ionospheric and neutral atmospheric refractive indices, in this effort, rays are traced along the full range of GPS-low Earth orbiting (LEO) radio links just as the measurements are made in real life. Here, ray shooting is employed to realize the observed radio links with controlled accuracy. CRT largely reproduces the very measured characteristics of GPS signals. When compared, the measured and simulated phases show remarkable agreement. The cross validation between CRT and GPS RO has confirmed not only the strength of CRT but also the high accuracy of GPS RO measurements. The primary motivation for this study is enabling effective quality control for GPS RO data, overcoming a complicated error structure in the high-level data. CRT has also shown a great deal of potential for improved utilization of GPS RO data for geophysical research."	0148-0227		DEC 29	2010	115							D24119	10.1029/2010JD014419

A global climate model predicts that emissions from a fleet of 1000 launches per year of suborbital rockets would create a persistent layer of black carbon particles in the northern stratosphere that could cause potentially significant changes in the global atmospheric circulation and distributions of ozone and temperature. Tropical stratospheric ozone abundances are predicted to change as much as 1%, while polar ozone changes by up to 6%. Polar surface temperatures change as much as one degree K regionally with significant impacts on polar sea ice fractions. After one decade of continuous launches, globally averaged radiative forcing from the black carbon would exceed the forcing from the emitted CO(2) by a factor of about 10(5) and would be comparable to the radiative forcing estimated from current subsonic aviation.

Multimodel assessment of the factors driving stratospheric ozone evolution over the 21st century	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The evolution of stratospheric ozone from 1960 to 2100 is examined in simulations from 14 chemistry-climate models, driven by prescribed levels of halogens and greenhouse gases. There is general agreement among the models that total column ozone reached a minimum around year 2000 at all latitudes, projected to be followed by an increase over the first half of the 21st century. In the second half of the 21st century, ozone is projected to continue increasing, level off, or even decrease depending on the latitude. Separation into partial columns above and below 20 hPa reveals that these latitudinal differences are almost completely caused by differences in the model projections of ozone in the lower stratosphere. At all latitudes, upper stratospheric ozone increases throughout the 21st century and is projected to return to 1960 levels well before the end of the century, although there is a spread among models in the dates that ozone returns to specific historical values. We find decreasing halogens and declining upper atmospheric temperatures, driven by increasing greenhouse gases, contribute almost equally to increases in upper stratospheric ozone. In the tropical lower stratosphere, an increase in upwelling causes a steady decrease in ozone through the 21st century, and total column ozone does not return to 1960 levels in most of the models. In contrast, lower stratospheric and total column ozone in middle and high latitudes increases during the 21st century, returning to 1960 levels well before the end of the century in most models."	0148-0227		DEC 21	2010	115							D24306	10.1029/2010JD014362

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud ""resolving"" models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed."	0148-0227		DEC 21	2010	115							D24211	10.1029/2010JD014532

Experiments on the temperature dependence of heterogeneous nucleation on nanometer-sized NaCl and Ag Particles	CHEMPHYSCHEM									"Experimental investigations on the activation of NaCl and Ag aerosol particles by heterogeneous nucleation of n-propanol vapor at well-defined vapor saturation ratios are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the temperature dependence of this process from -11 to + 14 degrees C. Aerosols are generated in a tube furnace and electrostatically classified at mean geometric mobility equivalent diameters between 3.6 and 11 nm. Activation probabilities are measured by means of expansion chamber experiments, and onset n-propanol saturation ratios are subsequently determined. The experiments with Ag particles do not produce any unexpected results. The results for NaCl particles, however, show a temperature trend of the onset saturation ratios that is opposite to that predicted by classical nucleation theory. This stresses the important role that surface properties play in heterogeneous nucleation processes. By tentatively assuming a temperature-dependent contact angle, we are able to theoretically reproduce this reversed temperature trend. In addition, the shrinkage of NaCl condensation particles is investigated for varying amounts of n-propanol vapor, and contact angle measurements are performed at temperatures ranging from -7 to + 30 degrees C."	1439-4235		DEC 17	2010	11	18			SI	3874	3882		10.1002/cphc.201000417

Estimation of total lightning from various storm parameters: A cloud-resolving model study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Because explicit prediction of the electrical activity in storms is computationally expensive and the processes are still poorly understood, an attractive way to predict lightning flash rates in numerical models is to rely on correlations between the flash rate and available model parameters. Predicted flash rates can be used for applications such as the parameterization to infer lightning-produced nitrogen oxides. In this study, the potential for six model parameters (precipitation ice mass, ice water path, ice mass flux product, updraft volume, maximum vertical velocity, and cloud top height) to predict lightning rate has been investigated in a cloud-resolving model framework. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is used to simulate two different storms: the 10 July 1996 severe storm that occurred over the High Plains and the 13 July 2005 airmass thunderstorm near Huntsville, Alabama. It is shown that the WRF model reproduces the structure of the two storms. Results show that the maximum updraft velocity gives a good flash rate proxy for the severe storm. The ice mass flux product and precipitation ice mass can reproduce the flash rate trend but not the magnitude. The flash rate estimated from the cloud top height does not match the observed flash rate trend and value of the severe storm, but is in good agreement for the airmass thunderstorm. The ice water path predicts flash rate fairly well for the severe storm, but overpredicts it for the airmass thunderstorm. The updraft volume predicts flash rate poorly for both storms."	0148-0227		DEC 16	2010	115							D24202	10.1029/2010JD014405

Greenhouse gas mitigation can reduce sea-ice loss and increase polar bear persistence	NATURE									"On the basis of projected losses of their essential sea-ice habitats, a United States Geological Survey research team concluded in 2007 that two-thirds of the world's polar bears (Ursus maritimus) could disappear by mid-century if business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions continue(1-3). That projection, however, did not consider the possible benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. A key question is whether temperature increases lead to proportional losses of sea-ice habitat, or whether sea-ice cover crosses a tipping point and irreversibly collapses when temperature reaches a critical threshold(4-6). Such a tipping point would mean future greenhouse gas mitigation would confer no conservation benefits to polar bears. Here we show, using a general circulation model(7), that substantially more sea-ice habitat would be retained if greenhouse gas rise is mitigated. We also show, with Bayesian network model outcomes, that increased habitat retention under greenhouse gas mitigation means that polar bears could persist throughout the century in greater numbers and more areas than in the business-as-usual case(3). Our general circulation model outcomes did not reveal thresholds leading to irreversible loss of ice(6); instead, a linear relationship between global mean surface air temperature and sea-ice habitat substantiated the hypothesis that sea-ice thermodynamics can overcome albedo feedbacks proposed to cause sea-ice tipping points(5,6,8). Our outcomes indicate that rapid summer ice losses in models(9) and observations(6,10) represent increased volatility of a thinning sea-ice cover, rather than tipping-point behaviour. Mitigation-driven Bayesian network outcomes show that previously predicted declines in polar bear distribution and numbers(3) are not unavoidable. Because polar bears are sentinels of the Arctic marine ecosystem(11) and trends in their sea-ice habitats foreshadow future global changes, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to improve polar bear status would have conservation benefits throughout and beyond the Arctic(12)."	0028-0836		DEC 16	2010	468	7326				955	U351		10.1038/nature09653

Using a global magnetohydrodynamic model to study the start of the substorm recovery phase	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"Magnetospheric substorms are a key manifestation of the transfer of energy from the solar wind to the Earth. Substorms consist of a loading of energy from the solar wind via magnetic reconnection and then a rapid release of that energy. One of the results of this energy release is the intense brightening of the aurora observed in the Earth's high-latitude regions. At some point, the dissipation of energy peaks and the system recovers. This paper focuses on addressing the question of what causes the transition to the recovery phase of the substorm typically defined by the retreat of the substorm magnetic reconnection site, or neutral line, in the magnetotail. One suggested hypothesis is that the expansion of the dipolarization of the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere causes the neutral line to move tailward. We use the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry magnetohydrodynamic code to model seven substorms to examine what causes the neutral line retreat in the simulation. We conclude that while the simulation reproduces the substorms with the loading and unloading of energy, the retreat of the neutral line is a directly driven process that is controlled by the solar wind."	0148-0227		DEC 16	2010	115							A12237	10.1029/2010JA015802

Role of magnetosheath force balance in regulating the dayside reconnection potential	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"When the interplanetary magnetic field ( IMF) is southward, most of the ionospheric potential is generated by merging between the IMF and the magnetospheric field. Typically, the ionospheric potential responds linearly to the magnitude of the southward IMF. However, when the IMF magnitude is large, the ionospheric potential saturates and it becomes relatively insensitive to further increases in the IMF magnitude. We present evidence from simulations that under purely southward IMF conditions, the value of the portion of the potential due to reconnection is controlled by the divergence of the magnetosheath flow, which determines the geoeffective length in the solar wind. Typically, the gradient in the plasma pressure controls the magnetosheath flow, so as the southward IMF increases in magnitude, the change in the magnetosheath force balance is negligible, the geoeffective length in the solar wind does not change, and the reconnection potential increases linearly with the magnitude of the IMF. However, when the IMF magnitude increases to the point where J x B becomes the dominant force in the magnetosheath, further increases in IMF magnitude do affect the overall force balance, diverting more flow away from the merging line, decreasing the geoeffective length, and limiting the global merging rate. Thus magnetosheath force balance can be seen as a single organizing factor that regulates the geoeffective length in the solar wind for the entire range of solar wind parameters."	0148-0227		DEC 8	2010	115							A12216	10.1029/2009JA014597

Regional patterns of tropical clouds emerge from the data, matching expectations from existing observations. The advantage of the lidar is highlighted by the distribution of cloud-top height, revealing the preponderance of low-level clouds over the tropical oceans. Over land, cloud top is more uniformly distributed under the influence of diurnal variation. The integrated cloud-top distribution suggests tropical, marine low-cloud amount around 25-30%; a merged CALIPSO-CloudSat product has a similar cloud-top distribution and includes a complementary estimate of cloud fraction based on the lidar detections. The low-cloud distribution is similar to that found in fields of shallow cumulus observed during the Rain in Cumulus Over the Ocean (RICO) field study. The similarity is enhanced by sampling near the RICO site or sampling large-scale conditions similar to those during RICO.

Thermosphere extension of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"In atmospheric and space environment studies it is key to understand and to quantify the coupling of atmospheric regions and the solar impacts on the whole atmosphere system. There is thus a need for a numerical model that encompasses the whole atmosphere and can self-consistently simulate the dynamic, physical, chemical, radiative, and electrodynamic processes that are important for the Sun-Earth system. This is the goal for developing the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). In this work, we report the development and preliminary validation of the thermospheric extension of WACCM (WACCM-X), which extends from the Earth's surface to the upper thermosphere. The WACCM-X uses the finite volume dynamical core from the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model and includes an interactive chemistry module resolving most known neutral chemistry and major ion chemistry in the middle and upper atmosphere, and photolysis and photoionization. Upper atmosphere processes, such as nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium, radiative transfer, auroral processes, ion drag, and molecular diffusion of major and minor species, have been included in the model. We evaluate the model performance by examining the quantities essential for the climate and weather of the upper atmosphere: the mean compositional, thermal, and wind structures from the troposphere to the upper thermosphere and their variability on interannual, seasonal, and daily scales. These quantities are compared with observational and previous model results."	0148-0227		DEC 4	2010	115							A12302	10.1029/2010JA015586

Comparing radiosonde and COSMIC atmospheric profile data to quantify differences among radiosonde types and the effects of imperfect collocation on comparison statistics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Collocated global atmospheric temperature, humidity, and refractivity profiles from radiosondes and from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation data for April 2008 to October 2009 are compared for two purposes. The first is to quantify the error characteristics of 12 radiosonde types flown in the global operational network, as a function of height and for both day and nighttime observations, for each of the three variables. The second is to determine the effects of imperfect temporal and spatial collocation on the radiosonde-COSMIC differences, for application to the general problem of satellite calibration and validation using in situ sounding data. Statistical analyses of the comparisons reveal differences among radiosonde types in refractivity, relative humidity, and radiation-corrected temperature data. Most of the radiosonde types show a dry bias, particularly in the upper troposphere, with the bias in daytime drier than in nighttime. Weather-scale variability, introduced by collocation time and distance mismatch, affects the comparison of radiosonde and COSMIC data by increasing the standard deviation errors, which are generally proportional to the size of the time and distance mismatch within the collocation window of 6 h and 250 km considered. Globally, in the troposphere (850-200 hPa), the collocation mismatch impacts on the comparison standard deviation errors for temperature are 0.35 K per 3 h and 0.42 K per 100 km and, for relative humidity, are 3.3% per 3 h and 3.1% per 100 km, indicating an approximate equivalence of 3 h to 100 km in terms of mismatch impact."	0148-0227		DEC 3	2010	115							D23104	10.1029/2010JD014457

Variations of the nighttime thermospheric mass density at low and middle latitudes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"The latitudinal structure of the nighttime thermospheric mass density at 385 km has been investigated using observations made by the accelerometer onboard the CHAMP satellite between 2002 and 2007. The nighttime thermospheric mass density had a clear latitudinal variation. There was a local density peak around the geographic equator and two minima at about +/- 30 degrees. This nighttime equatorial mass anomaly (NEMA) was opposite to the latitudinal variations of the daytime ionospheric equatorial anomaly and thermospheric mass density anomaly as both have minima at the magnetic dip equator and maxima around +/- 20 degrees in magnetic latitudes. This anomalous behavior of the nighttime thermospheric mass density had strong local time, seasonal, hemispheric, and solar cycle dependences. The largest crest-to-trough ratio between the peak density at the equator and the minima at the anomaly latitudes (+/- 30 degrees) occurred between 0000 and 0200 local time. The NEMA appeared to be more pronounced during solstice seasons. It was also stronger during solar minimum than during solar maximum. In addition, under the same geophysical conditions, the empirical NRLMSISE-00 model shows similar but much weaker nighttime mass density anomaly features at low and middle latitudes. A high-resolution National Center for Atmospheric Research-Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Global Circulation Model (TIMEGCM) simulation reproduced most of the observed latitudinal variations of the nighttime mass density as well as the thermospheric midnight temperature maximum (MTM). Model results suggest that superposition of diurnal and semidiurnal migrating tides of modes up to wave number 6 is the likely cause of both the NEMA and MTM phenomena."	0148-0227		DEC 2	2010	115							A12301	10.1029/2010JA015784

In this work, we study the meridional transport associated with the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) and migrating tides. Diagnostic calculations are performed to trace the particle trajectories using winds from the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) simulations for January, when the amplitude of the QTDW usually peaks. The calculations demonstrate that the mean meridional circulation, a QTDW or a migrating tide cannot individually sustain planetary-scale meridional transport for one to three days, but the combined effects of a QTDW and a tide can. In particular, when the QTDW and the tides are scaled according to the observed amplitudes, particles released at similar to 110 km and appropriate longitudes/local times can under go transport fast enough to reach Antarctica within three days as observed. The magnitude and direction of the transport depend on the amplitudes and phases of the tides and the QTDW. These simulations thus suggest that the observed rapid planetary-scale meridional transport of the shuttle main engine plume can be driven by planetary waves and tides. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements of zonal winds were -5.4 to 7.6 m/s, 2.3 to 23.0 m/s, and -22.6 to 49.3 m/s. The average data from the observations was consistent with the data from HWM93. The wind data at heights of 87 and 98 km suggest a semi-diurnal oscillation, clearly consistent with HWM93 results. Conversely there was a clear discrepancy between the observations and the model at 250 km. In general, this Fabry-Perot interferometer is a useful ground-based instrument for measuring mesospheric and thermospheric winds at middle latitudes."	1001-6538		DEC	2010	55	35				4046	4051		10.1007/s11434-010-4192-2

Layered structures in the upper Ligurian Sea	NUOVO CIMENTO DELLA SOCIETA ITALIANA DI FISICA B-BASIC TOPICS IN PHYSICS									"During the dedicated sea-truth cruise LIGURE2007, a part of the intensive observational campaign Ligurian Sea Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (LASIE) performed in the eastern Ligurian Sea (Italy) from 16th to 23rd June in 2007, the R/V Urania carried out an intensive microstructure measurement program. Most of these measurements were made between 17th and 20th, in the vicinity of a spar buoy anchored 60 km off the coast in a region with a water column depth of approximately 1500 m; the prevailing light wind conditions and intense solar radiation limited the depth of the upper mixed layer to about 10-15 m. We carried out measurements of the structure of the upper water column to a depth exceeding about 200 m. Interestingly, the microstructure measurements revealed multiple layers of relatively elevated dissipation and diffusivity rates around a. depth of about 100 m. Since the water column is shown not to be not conducive to double-diffusion, these layered structures must have been produced by small-scale shear due to other processes, such as breaking internal waves. In this paper, we describe the oceanographic conditions prevailing at the time of the measurements, as well as the general turbulent properties in the upper part of the water column. In particular, the layered structures below the mixed layer are discussed in detail, with suggestions as to the likely origin and possible ways of investigating these processes."	2037-4895		DEC	2010	125	12				1567	1586		10.1393/ncb/i2010-10945-8

Helicity (correlation between the velocity and its curl) has relevance for atmospheric and astrophysical flows and can also affect mixing. In this paper, decaying three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is studied via direct numerical simulations (DNS) for an isotropic non-rotating flow and for rotating flows with and without helicity. We analyze the cases of moderate Rossby number and large Reynolds number, focusing on the behavior of the energy spectrum at large scales and studying its effect on the time evolution of the energy and integral scales for E(k) similar to k(4) initial conditions. In the non-rotating case, we observe the classical energy decay rate t(-10/7) and a growth of the integral length proportional to t(2/7) in agreement with the prediction obtained assuming conservation of the Loitsyanski integral. In the presence of rotation we observe a decoupling in the decay of the modes perpendicular to the rotation axis from the remaining 3D modes. These slow modes show a behavior similar to that found in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, whereas the 3D modes decay as in the isotropic case. We phenomenologically explain the decay considering integral conserved quantities that depend on the large-scale anisotropic spectrum. The decoupling of modes is also observed for a flow with a net amount of helicity. In this case, the 3D modes decay as an isotropic fluid with a constant, constrained integral length and the 2D modes decay as a constrained rotating fluid with maximum helicity."	0031-8949		DEC	2010	T142							014003	10.1088/0031-8949/2010/T142/014003

One of these aimed at identifying needs in middle-income and low-income countries (MLICs), and found that effective responses to the challenge of reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptation will drive research and policy into challenging and innovative areas of research. Producing impacts, vulnerability and adaptation knowledge requires greater inclusion of MLIC researchers and a rethinking of the research structures, institutions and paradigms that have dominated global change research to date. Scientific literature discussed in this article suggests that governance issues need to become central objects of empirically based, detailed, multiscalar and action-oriented research, and that this needs to address the politically sensitive and seemingly intractable issue of reducing global inequities in power and resource distribution. The scientific literature suggests that without effective action in those directions, current trends toward greater inequality will continue to both reflect and intensify global environmental threats and their impacts."	1877-3435		DEC	2010	2	6-May				364	374		10.1016/j.cosust.2010.10.009

The original model utilized central and environmental surface pressures, maximum winds, and radius of maximum winds. In the revision a capacity to incorporate additional wind observations at some radius within the hurricane circulation was included. If surface observations are used, then a surface wind profile will result, obviating the need for deriving a boundary layer reduction from the gradient wind level.

"Convective snowbands downstream of the Rocky Mountains in an environment with conditional, dry symmetric, and inertial instabilities"	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Convective snowbands moved slowly over Wyoming and northern Colorado on 16-17 February 2007 and produced up to 71 mm (2.8 in.) of snow that was unpredicted by operational numerical weather prediction models and human forecasters. The northwest southeast-oriented bands lasted for over 6 h, comprising both a single major band (more than 30 km wide) and multiple minor bands (about 10 km wide). The convective bands initiated within the ascending branch of a secondary circulation associated with both near-surface and elevated frontogenesis, but the bands remained nearly stationary while the near-surface frontogenesis moved quickly equatorward. The bands occurred downstream of complex terrain on the anticyclonic-shear side of a midlevel jet streak, where conditional, dry symmetric (negative potential vorticity), and inertial (negative absolute vorticity) instabilities were present. To determine the mechanisms responsible for the development and organization of these bands, simulations using a convection-permitting numerical model are conducted. In contrast to the operational models, these simulations are able to produce convective bands in the same area and at about the same time as that observed. The simulated bands occurred in an environment with a nearly well-mixed, baroclinic boundary layer, positive convective available potential energy. and widespread negative potential vorticity. Individual bands initiated on the low-momentum side of vorticity banners downstream of mountains, and in association with frontogenetical ascent along two baroclinic zones. In addition, ascent caused by both frontogenesis and banded moist convection produced additional narrow regions of negative vorticity by transporting low-momentum air upward and creating strong horizontal gradients in wind speed. This event is similar to other observed instances of banded convection in the western United States on the anticyclonic-shear side of strong mid- and upper-tropospheric jets in environments lacking large-scale saturation. In contrast, these events differ from previously published banded precipitation events in the comma head of extratropical cyclones and downstream of mountains where large-scale saturation is present."	0027-0644		DEC	2010	138	12				4416	4438		10.1175/2010MWR3334.1

Changes in tornado intensity are compared to the position of the tornado relative to primary and secondary gust fronts. Circulation on scales of a few kilometers surrounding the tornado remains relatively constant during the analysis period, which spans the intensifying and mature periods of the tornado's life cycle. Stretching of vertical vorticity and tilting of horizontal vorticity are diagnosed, but the latter is near or below the threshold of delectability in this analysis during the observation period in the analyzed domain. Low-level circulation within 500 m of the tornado increased several minutes before vortex-relative and ground-relative near-surface wind speeds in the tornado increased, raising the possibility that such trends in circulation may be useful in forecasting tornado intensification."	0027-0644		DEC	2010	138	12				4439	4455		10.1175/2010MWR3330.1

Model 3-hourly precipitation accumulations were compared to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 satellite-derived precipitation in the low- and midlatitude Pacific Ocean during 1998-2000. Overall, the spatial distribution of annual mean precipitation (i.e., the clear shape of the ITCZ with two maxima one located in the east and one in the west) was reproduced well by the WRF model: however, there was considerably more precipitation in the WRF simulation than in the TRMM dataset. Object-based analysis identified more precipitation objects with life spans less than 30 h and fewer objects with life spans longer than 60 h in the TRMM dataset compared to the WRF simulation. Objects with the longest life span (>90 h) tended to occur in similar regions in both the modeled and satellite-derived datasets. Two of these regions were in the western part of the domain and one was in the eastern portion of the ITCZ, although these regions did not necessarily coincide with the regions of maximum precipitation accumulations. Both datasets had mostly eastward movement in the midlatitudes. The datasets, however, diverged around the central part of the ITCZ where the TRMM dataset displayed both eastward and westward movement, while westward movement was dominant in the WRF simulation.

For the first time a high-resolution atmospheric model especially adapted for polar regions was used for such a study in Dronning Maud Land. The outstanding event of 21-25 February 2003 was connected to a strong north-westerly flow, caused by a blocking high above eastern Dronning Maud Land, that persisted for several days and brought unusually large levels of moisture to the Antarctic Plateau. This weather situation is most effective in bringing precipitation to high-altitude interior Antarctic ice-core drilling sites, where precipitation in the form of diamond dust usually dominates. However, a few such precipitation events per year can account for a large percentage of the annual accumulation, which can cause a strong bias in ice-core data. Additionally, increased temperatures and wind speeds during these events need to be taken into account for the correct climatic interpretation of ice cores. A better understanding of the frequency of occurrence of intermittent precipitation in the interior of Antarctica in past and future climates is necessary for both palaeoclimatological studies and estimates of future sea-level change."	0800-0395		DEC	2010	29	3				330	344		10.1111/j.1751-8369.2010.00164.x

"Nowcasting challenges during the Beijing Olympics: Successes, failures, and implications for future nowcasting systems"	WEATHER AND FORECASTING									"The Beijing 2008 Forecast Demonstration Project (B08FDP) included a variety of nowcasting systems from China, Australia, Canada, and the United States. A goal of the B08FDP was to demonstrate state-of-the-art nowcasting systems within a mutual operational setting. The nowcasting systems were a mix of radar echo extrapolation methods, numerical models, techniques that blended numerical model and extrapolation methods, and systems incorporating forecaster input. This paper focuses on the skill of the nowcasting systems to forecast convective storms that threatened or affected the Summer Olympic Games held in Beijing, China. The topography surrounding Beijing provided unique challenges in that it often enhanced the degree and extent of storm initiation, growth, and dissipation, which took place over short time and space scales. The skill levels of the numerical techniques were inconsistent from hour to hour and day to day and it was speculated that without assimilation of real-time radar reflectivity and Doppler velocity fields to support model initialization, particularly for weakly forced convective events, it would be very difficult for models to provide accurate forecasts on the nowcasting time and space scales. Automated blending techniques tended to be no more skillful than extrapolation since they depended heavily on the models to provide storm initiation, growth, and dissipation. However, even with the cited limitations among individual nowcasting systems, the Chinese Olympic forecasters considered the B08FDP human consensus forecasts to be useful. Key to the success of the human forecasts was the development of nowcasting rules predicated on the character of Beijing convective weather realized over the previous two summers. Based on the B08FDP experience, the status of nowcasting convective storms and future directions are presented."	0882-8156		DEC	2010	25	6				1691	1714		10.1175/2010WAF2222417.1

These forecasts covered 10 Atlantic tropical cyclones: 6 from the 2005 season and 4 from 2007. The forecasts were integrated from identical initial conditions produced by a cycling ensemble Kalman filter. The high-resolution forecasts used moving, storm-centered nests of 4- and 1.33-km grid spacing. The coarse-resolution forecasts consisted of a single 12-km domain (which was identical to the outer domain in the forecasts with nests). Forecasts were evaluated out to 120 h. Novel verification techniques were developed to evaluate forecasts of wind radii and the degree of storm asymmetry. Intensity (maximum wind) and rapid intensification, as well as wind radii, were all predicted more accurately with increased horizontal resolution. These results were deemed to be statistically significant based on the application of bootstrap confidence intervals. No statistically significant differences emerged regarding storm position errors between the two forecasts. Coarse-resolution forecasts tended to overpredict the extent of winds compared to high-resolution forecasts. The asymmetry of gale-force winds was better predicted in the coarser-resolution simulation, but asymmetry of hurricane-force winds was predicted better at high resolution. The skill of the wind radii forecasts decayed gradually over 120 h, suggesting a synoptic-scale control of the predictability of outer winds."	0882-8156		DEC	2010	25	6				1826	1841		10.1175/2010WAF2222423.1

The analysis focuses on the wettest 10% of months during the cold half of the year (October-March), when it is assumed that resolved synoptic circulation governs precipitation. For a coastal California region where the precipitation is largely topographic, the models individually and collectively replicate well the monthly frequency of extremes, the amount of extreme precipitation, and the 500-hPa circulation anomaly associated with the extremes. The models also replicate very well the statistics of the interannual variability of occurrences of extremes. For an interior region containing the upper Mississippi River basin, where precipitation is more dependent on internally generated storms, the models agree with observations in both monthly frequency and magnitude, although not as closely as for coastal California. In addition, simulated circulation anomalies for extreme months are similar to those in observations.

Observations were obtained as part of an International Heliophysical Year campaign by instruments from a variety of space-and ground-based observatories, spanning wavelengths from radio to soft X-ray to integrated white light. From these data it is clear that the prominence cavity is the limb manifestation of a longitudinally extended polar-crown filament channel, and that the cavity is a region of low density relative to the surrounding corona. As a first step toward quantifying density and temperature from campaign spectroscopic data, we establish the three-dimensional morphology of the cavity. This is critical for taking line-of-sight projection effects into account, since cavities are not localized in the plane of the sky and the corona is optically thin. We have augmented a global coronal streamer model to include a tunnel-like cavity with elliptical cross-section and a Gaussian variation of height along the tunnel length. We have developed a semi-automated routine that fits ellipses to cross-sections of the cavity as it rotates past the solar limb, and have applied it to Extreme Ultraviolet Imager observations from the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft. This defines the morphological parameters of our model, from which we reproduce forward-modeled cavity observables. We find that cavity morphology and orientation, in combination with the viewpoints of the observing spacecraft, explain the observed variation in cavity visibility for the east versus west limbs."	0004-637X		DEC 1	2010	724	2				1133	1146		10.1088/0004-637X/724/2/1133

We solve the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations governing marine flows on a mesh made up of triangles extruded from the surface toward the seabed to obtain prismatic three-dimensional elements. Diffusion is implemented using the symmetric interior penalty method. The tracer equation is consistent with the continuity equation. A Lax-Friedrichs flux is used to take into account internal wave propagation. By way of illustration, a flow exhibiting internal waves in the lee of an isolated seamount on the sphere is simulated. This enables us to show the advantages of using an unstructured mesh, where the resolution is higher in areas where the flow varies rapidly in space, the mesh being coarser far from the region of interest. The solution exhibits the expected wave structure. Linear and quadratic shape functions are used, and the extension to higher-order discretization is straightforward."	1616-7341		DEC	2010	60	6				1371	1393		10.1007/s10236-010-0358-3

However, the homogeneity of gridded datasets is rarely questioned, even though an analysis of trends or variability that uses inhomogeneous data could be misleading or even erroneous. Three gridded precipitation datasets that have been used in studies of the Upper Colorado River basin were tested for homogeneity in this study: that of Maurer et al., that of Beyene and Lettenmaier, and the Parameter Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset of Daly et al. Four absolute homogeneity tests were applied to annual precipitation amounts on a grid cell and on a hydrologic subregion spatial scale for the periods 1950-99 and 1916-2006. The analysis detects breakpoints in 1977 and 1978 at many locations in all three datasets that may be due to an anomalously rapid shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation. One dataset showed breakpoints in the 1940s that might be due to the widespread change in the number of available observing stations used as input for that dataset. The results also indicated that the time series from the three datasets are sufficiently homogeneous for variability analysis during the 1950-99 period when aggregated on a subregional scale."	1558-8424		DEC	2010	49	12				2404	2415		10.1175/2010JAMC2484.1

We apply the radiative kernel technique to transient simulations from a multi-thousand member perturbed physics ensemble of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, comparing distributions of model feedbacks with those taken from the CMIP-3 multi GCM ensemble. Although the range of clear sky longwave feedbacks in the perturbed physics ensemble is similar to that seen in the multi-GCM ensemble, the kernel technique underestimates the net clear-sky feedbacks (or the radiative forcing) in some perturbed models with significantly altered humidity distributions. In addition, the compensating relationship between global mean atmospheric lapse rate feedback and water vapor feedback is found to hold in the perturbed physics ensemble, but large differences in relative humidity distributions in the ensemble prevent the compensation from holding at a regional scale. Both ensembles show a similar range of response of global mean net cloud feedback, but the mean of the perturbed physics ensemble is shifted towards more positive values such that none of the perturbed models exhibit a net negative cloud feedback. The perturbed physics ensemble contains fewer models with strong negative shortwave cloud feedbacks and has stronger compensating positive longwave feedbacks. A principal component analysis used to identify dominant modes of feedback variation reveals that the perturbed physics ensemble produces very different modes of climate response to the multi-model ensemble, suggesting that one may not be used as an analog for the other in estimates of uncertainty in future response. Whereas in the multi-model ensemble, the first order variation in cloud feedbacks shows compensation between longwave and shortwave components, in the perturbed physics ensemble the shortwave feedbacks are uncompensated, possibly explaining the larger range of climate sensitivities observed in the perturbed simulations. Regression analysis suggests that the parameters governing cloud formation, convection strength and ice fall speed are the most significant in altering climate feedbacks. Perturbations of oceanic and sulfur cycle parameters have relatively little effect on the atmospheric feedbacks diagnosed by the kernel technique."	0930-7575		DEC	2010	35	8-Jul				1219	1236		10.1007/s00382-009-0661-1

This paper analyzes the trends and variability in T (max), T (min), and DTR over land in observations and 48 simulations from 12 global coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for the later half of the 20th century. It uses the modeled changes in surface downward solar and longwave radiation to interpret the modeled temperature changes. When anthropogenic and natural forcings are included, the models generally reproduce observed major features of the warming of T (max) and T (min) and the reduction of DTR. As expected the greenhouse gases enhanced surface downward longwave radiation (DLW) explains most of the warming of T (max) and T (min) while decreased surface downward shortwave radiation (DSW) due to increasing aerosols and water vapor contributes most to the decreases in DTR in the models. When only natural forcings are used, none of the observed trends are simulated. The simulated DTR decreases are much smaller than the observed (mainly due to the small simulated T (min) trend) but still outside the range of natural internal variability estimated from the models. The much larger observed decrease in DTR suggests the possibility of additional regional effects of anthropogenic forcing that the models can not realistically simulate, likely connected to changes in cloud cover, precipitation, and soil moisture. The small magnitude of the simulated DTR trends may be attributed to the lack of an increasing trend in cloud cover and deficiencies in charactering aerosols and important surface and boundary-layer processes in the models."	0930-7575		DEC	2010	35	8-Jul				1289	1307		10.1007/s00382-009-0644-2

We investigate the variability of Fram Strait sea ice motion and the role of atmospheric circulation forcing using daily data during the period 1979-2006. The most prominent atmospheric driver of anomalous sea ice motion across Fram Strait is an east-west dipole pattern of Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies with centers of action located over the Barents Sea and Greenland. This pattern, also observed in synoptic studies, is associated with anomalous meridional winds across Fram Strait and is thus physically consistent with forcing changes in sea ice motion. The association between the SLP dipole pattern and Fram Strait ice motion is maximized at 0-lag, persists year-round, and is strongest on time scales of 10-60 days. The SLP dipole pattern is the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of daily SLP anomalies in both winter and summer. When the analysis is repeated with monthly data, only the Barents center of the SLP dipole remains significantly correlated with Fram Strait sea ice motion. However, after removing the leading EOF of monthly SLP variability (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation), the full east-west dipole pattern is recovered. No significant SLP forcing of Fram Strait ice motion is found in summer using monthly data, even when the leading EOF is removed. Our results highlight the importance of high frequency atmospheric variability in forcing Fram Strait sea ice motion."	0930-7575		DEC	2010	35	8-Jul				1349	1360		10.1007/s00382-009-0647-z

We compare CAM3 output with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 40 year reanalysis (ERA-40) data. We formulate a time mean temperature bias equation then evaluate each term in the equation. Our focus is on the Northern Hemisphere winter time. We group the temperature equation terms into these categories: linear advection terms, nonlinear advection terms, transient eddy terms and diabatic heating, and find that linear advection and diabatic bias are the largest. The nonlinear terms (velocity bias advection of temperature bias) are much smaller than each of the other groups of terms at all levels except near the surface. Linear advection terms have dipolar pattern in the Atlantic (negative NW of positive) which reflects the shift of the CAM3 model North Atlantic storm track (NAST) into Europe, especially in the upper troposphere; opposite sign dipolar structure occurs over Alaska (positive) and the north Pacific storm track (negative). The transient advection terms in middle latitudes are larger in the upper troposphere and generally positive along the Atlantic storm track. Along the north Pacific storm track (NPST), the transient terms are negative in the mid and lower troposphere over much of the NPST (positive in upper troposphere). The diabatic heating bias has large values in the tropics along the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICZ) and along the midlatitude storm tracks. During this time of year the ICZ is mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, but CAM3 emphasizes an ICZ-like heating in the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. CAM3 tends to have a weaker ICZ, especially in the Atlantic. In midlatitudes, we find large bias in heating by precipitation and vertically averaged net radiation over the NAST, Europe, and the Middle East."	0930-7575		DEC	2010	35	8-Jul				1411	1427		10.1007/s00382-009-0608-6

At present, however, there are uncertainties in: the total radiative forcing associated with changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere; the effective forcing applied to the climate system resulting from a (temporary) reduction via ocean-heat uptake; and the strength of the climate feedbacks that subsequently modify this forcing. Here a set of analyses derived from atmospheric general circulation model simulations are used to estimate the effective and total radiative forcing of the observed climate system due to anthropogenic emissions over the last 50 years of the twentieth century. They are also used to estimate the sensitivity of the observed climate system to these emissions, as well as the expected change in global surface temperatures once the climate system returns to radiative equilibrium. Results indicate that estimates of the effective radiative forcing and total radiative forcing associated with historical anthropogenic emissions differ across models. In addition estimates of the historical sensitivity of the climate to these emissions differ across models. However, results suggest that the variations in climate sensitivity and total climate forcing are not independent, and that the two vary inversely with respect to one another. As such, expected equilibrium temperature changes, which are given by the product of the total radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity, are relatively constant between models, particularly in comparison to results in which the total radiative forcing is assumed constant. Implications of these results for projected future climate forcings and subsequent responses are also discussed."	0930-7575		DEC	2010	35	8-Jul				1461	1475		10.1007/s00382-010-0798-y

Constraints of a pulsation frequency on stellar parameters in the eclipsing spectroscopic binary system V577 Oph	ASTRONOMISCHE NACHRICHTEN		4th HELAS International Conference	2010-02-01-2010-02-05	"Canary Islands, SPAIN"					"We present a preliminary spectroscopic analysis of the binary system V577Oph, observed during the summer of 2007 on the 2.6m NOT telescope on La Palma. We have obtained time series spectroscopic observations, which show clear binary motion as well as radial velocity variations due to pulsation in the primary star. By modelling the radial velocities we determine a full orbital solution of the system, which yields M(A) sin(3) i = 1.562 +/- 0.012 M(circle dot) and M(B) sin(3) i = 1.461 +/- 0.020 M(circle dot). An estimate of inclination from photometry yields a primary mass of similar to 1.6 M(circle dot). Using this derived mass, and the known pulsation frequency we can impose a lower limit of 1 Gyr on the age of the system, and constrain the parameters of the oscillation mode. We show that with further analysis of the spectra (extracting the atmospheric parameters), tighter constraints could be imposed on the age, metallicity and the mode parameters. This work emphasizes the power that a single pulsation frequency can have for constraining stellar parameters in an eclipsing binary system. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.

Structures in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence: Detection and scaling	PHYSICAL REVIEW E									"We present a systematic analysis of statistical properties of turbulent current and vorticity structures at a given time using cluster analysis. The data stem from numerical simulations of decaying three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the absence of an imposed uniform magnetic field; the magnetic Prandtl number is taken equal to unity, and we use a periodic box with grids of up to 1536(3) points and with Taylor Reynolds numbers up to 1100. The initial conditions are either an X-point configuration embedded in three dimensions, the so-called Orszag-Tang vortex, or an Arn'old-Beltrami-Childress configuration with a fully helical velocity and magnetic field. In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one turn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation. We show that the algorithm is able to select a large number of structures (in excess of 8000) for each snapshot and that the statistical properties of these clusters are remarkably similar for the two snapshots as well as for the two flows under study in terms of scaling laws for the cluster characteristics, with the structures in the vorticity and in the current behaving in the same way. We also study the effect of Reynolds number on cluster statistics, and we finally analyze the properties of these clusters in terms of their velocity-magnetic-field correlation. Self-organized criticality features have been identified in the dissipative range of scales. A different scaling arises in the inertial range, which cannot be identified for the moment with a known self-organized criticality class consistent with magnetohydrodynamics. We suggest that this range can be governed by turbulence dynamics as opposed to criticality and propose an interpretation of intermittency in terms of propagation of local instabilities."	1539-3755		NOV 30	2010	82	5	Part 2					056326	10.1103/PhysRevE.82.056326

Cloud-aerosol interactions for boundary layer stratocumulus in the Lagrangian Cloud Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Lagrangian Cloud Model (LCM) is a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian approach to atmospheric large eddy simulation (LES), with two-way coupling between Eulerian dynamics and thermodynamics and Lagrangian microphysics. Since Lagrangian representation of microphysics does not suffer from numerical diffusion in the radius space and solves full droplet growth equations, it may be considered an alternative for the bin approach. This paper documents the development of LCM to include collision/coalescence processes. The proposed algorithm maps Lagrangian parcels collision/coalescence events on the specified two-dimensional grid, with the first dimension spanning aerosol radius and the second dimension spanning the cloud droplet radius. The proposed approach is capable of representation of aerosol activation, deactivation, transport inside the droplets, and processing by clouds and in the future may be used to investigate details of these processes. As an illustration, LCM with collision/coalescence is used to investigate effects of aerosols on cloud microphysics and dynamics for a marine stratocumulus cloud. Two extreme cases are considered that represent low and high aerosol concentrations. It is shown that the aerosol type significantly affects cloud microphysics as well as cloud dynamics. In agreement with previous studies, a larger entrainment rate is simulated for the high aerosol concentration. For the low aerosol concentration, intense collision/coalescence and drizzle modify the aerosol size distribution, reducing the concentration in the dry radius range of 0.02 to 0.2 mu m and increasing the concentration for dry radii larger than 0.3 mu m."	0148-0227		NOV 30	2010	115							D22214	10.1029/2010JD014248

Here, we use long and well-validated proxy reconstructions of Asian droughts and pluvials to detect the influence of volcanic radiative forcing on the hydroclimate of the region since the late Medieval period. Superposed epoch analysis reveals significantly wetter conditions over mainland southeast Asia in the year of an eruption, with drier conditions in central Asia. Our proxy and model comparison suggests that GCMs may not yet capture all of the important ocean-atmosphere dynamics responsible for the influence of explosive volcanism on the climate of Asia.

Parameterization of monoenergetic electron impact ionization	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"We report a new parameterization of ionization in the Earth's atmosphere by isotropically precipitating monoenergetic (100 eV to 1 MeV) electrons. This new parameterization is the first one based on sophisticated first-principle models, and represents a significant improvement in accuracy, particularly for incident auroral and lower energies. Without previous need to interpolate over source energy and atmospheric range, the new parameterization provides an easier implementation with a robust fit of model calculations for a wide range of incident energies and atmospheric conditions. By decomposing any incident energy spectrum into contiguous monoenergetic components and then calculating and integrating their resulting ionization, our parameterization is a valuable tool that can be used in conjunction with global models to accurately quantify the impact from realistic precipitating electrons during space weather events.

The approach is motivated by, and particularly suited to, the analysis of multimodel time series of varying length. This Time series Additive Model (TSAM) approach consists of three distinct steps: estimation of individual model trends, baseline adjustment of the trends, and the weighted combination of the individual model trends to produce a multimodel trend (MMT) estimate. The baseline adjustment step is not an essential ingredient of the TSAM but is included to reduce model spread. The association of the TSAM approach with a probabilistic model allows trend estimates to be used to make formal inference (e.g., calculation of confidence and prediction intervals). The method is applied to the analysis of multimodel ozone time series of varying lengths as were considered for the 2006 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion. The advantages of the TSAM approach are demonstrated to include the production of smooth trend estimates out to the ends of the time series, the ability to model explicitly interannual variability about the trend estimate, and the ability to make rigorous probability statements. Calculated ozone return dates are consistent with previous qualitative estimates, but the more quantitative analysis provided by the MMT is expected to allow such data sets to be better utilized by the community and policy makers."	0148-0227		NOV 24	2010	115							D00M12	10.1029/2009JD013622

Effects of solar wind dynamic pressure on the ionospheric O(+) fluence during the 31 August 2005 storm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"The Multifluid-Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (MFLFM) global simulation model incorporating an ionospheric cusp O(+) outflow model based on an empirical relation between downward DC Poynting flux and O(+) outflow flux regulated by the precipitating electron number flux (F(en)) is used to simulate the 31 August 2005 storm. A baseline run incorporating the original solar wind data is contrasted against a case where the solar wind dynamic pressure (P(dyn)) is artificially adjusted to see what effects this variable has on the O(+) fluence generated in the model. Consistent with data, it is found that both the fluence and O(+) outflow flux have a positive correlation with the solar wind dynamic pressure. Additionally, changes in P(dyn) affect the downward Poynting flux only marginally and regulates both outflow flux and cusp outflow area via F(en). Increases in P(dyn) lead to increased cusp electron precipitation, which has the physical effect of enhancing the upwelling O(+) population available for outflow."	0148-0227		NOV 24	2010	115							A00J07	10.1029/2010JA015583

Testing strict hydrostatic equilibrium in simulated clusters of galaxies: Implications for A1689	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"Accurate mass determination of clusters of galaxies is crucial if they are to be used as cosmological probes. However, there are some discrepancies between cluster masses determined based on gravitational lensing and X-ray observations assuming strict hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium gas pressure is provided entirely by thermal pressure). Cosmological simulations suggest that turbulent gas motions remaining from hierarchical structure formation may provide a significant contribution to the equilibrium pressure in clusters. We analyze a sample of massive clusters of galaxies drawn from high-resolution cosmological simulations and find a significant contribution (20%-45%) from non-thermal pressure near the center of relaxed clusters, and, in accord with previous studies, a minimum contribution at about 0.1 R(vir), growing to about 30%-45% at the virial radius, R(vir). Our results strongly suggest that relaxed clusters should have significant non-thermal support in their core region. As an example, we test the validity of strict hydrostatic equilibrium in the well-studied massive galaxy cluster A1689 using the latest high-resolution gravitational lensing and X-ray observations. We find a contribution of about 40% from non-thermal pressure within the core region of A1689, suggesting an alternate explanation for the mass discrepancy: the strict hydrostatic equilibrium is not valid in this region."	2041-8205		NOV 20	2010	724	1				L1	L4		10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L1

The magnitude and occurrence of GWs correlate with the location and strength of the polar vortex that is strongly disturbed by planetary wave (PW) growth. This location dependence on PW phase explains the observed GW variability during SSWs. During the development and the onset of SSW, the zonal-mean GW potential energy density (GW-Ep) increases on January 5 and 15-22 in association with the growth of PW wavenumber 1 and wavenumber 2, respectively. As the initial prominent PW magnitude in the lower mesosphere progresses downward, GW-Ep enhancement also seems to show a corresponding descent from January 5-22. GW-Ep peaks before the wind reversal occurrence and significantly weakens after the SSW. These variations are confirmed by COSMIC/GPS observations. Lidar data from Antarctica are also used to validate GWs as derived in ECMWF. Citation: Yamashita, C., H.-L. Liu, and X.

A class of deformational flow test cases for linear transport problems on the sphere	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS									"A class of new benchmark deformational flow test cases for the two-dimensional horizontal linear transport problems on the sphere is proposed. The scalar field follows complex trajectories and undergoes severe deformation during the simulation; however, the flow reverses its course at half-time and the scalar field returns to its initial position and shape. This process makes the exact solution available at the end of the simulation, and facilitates assessment of the accuracy of the underlying transport scheme. A procedure to eliminate possible cancellations of errors when the flow reverses is proposed. The test suite consists of four cases. Three are based on non-divergent flow fields and one on a divergent flow. The initial conditions are prescribed in terms of regular latitude-longitude spherical coordinates and are easy to implement. The divergent flow is specifically aimed for conservative global transport schemes to test for conservation, consistency and monotonicity (or positivity) of limiters/filters in a challenging flow environment. In the context of semi-Lagrangian schemes, the time-varying flow fields can be used to test trajectory algorithms where the exact trajectories do not follow great-circle arcs. The characteristics of the test cases are demonstrated with two different transport schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

On the uncertainty of radio occultation inversions in the lower troposphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Development of radio-holographic inversion methods that solve for multipath propagation of radio occultation signals in the moist lower troposphere resulted in significant reduction of inversion errors of the bending angle and refractivity. Still, inversion errors depend on the length of recorded radio occultation signals, additive noise, and some tunable inversion parameters. These errors have components with nonzero mean (biases) and thus must be understood and quantified for weather and climate applications. In this study a physical explanation of the above mentioned inversion biases is given and their magnitude is evaluated (about 1% in the tropical lower troposphere). Assuming data with 50 Hz sampling rate and a noise level that is typical for the COSMIC GPS radio occultation observations, this magnitude can be considered as the measure of uncertainty of radio holographic inversions below similar to 5 km in the moist tropical troposphere."	0148-0227		NOV 20	2010	115							D22111	10.1029/2010JD014058

The peak density (NmF2), peak height (hmF2), and ionospheric total electron content (ITEC) increase in the morning hours and decrease in the afternoon globally for 75% of the cases, in which electron density profiles during SSW and non-SSW days are available around the same location and local time bins. NmF2, hmF2, and ITEC during SSW days, on average, increase 19%, 12 km, and 17% in the morning and decrease 23%, 19 km, and 25% in the afternoon, respectively, in comparison with those during non-SSW days from global COSMIC observations. These results agree well with previous results from total electron content observations in low-latitude and equatorial regions. Interestingly, the unique COSMIC observations also revealed that during this SSW event the ionosphere responds globally, not only in the equatorial regions but also at the high and middle latitudes. The high-latitude ionosphere shows increased NmF2 and ITEC and decreased hmF2 in either the morning or afternoon sector. Thus, these results indicate that the ionospheric response in low-middle latitude and equatorial regions during SSW can be explained by either the modulated vertical drift resulting from the interaction between the planetary waves and tides through E region dynamo or the possible direct propagation of tides from the lower atmosphere, whereas the ionospheric variations at the middle and high latitude during the SSW might be attributed to the neutral background changes due to the direct propagation of tides from the lower atmosphere to the ionospheric F2 region. The competitive effects of different physical processes, such as the electric field, neutral wind, and composition, might cause the complex features of ionospheric variations during this SSW event."	0148-0227		NOV 20	2010	115							A00G09	10.1029/2010JA015466

Associated with these external forcings were systematic changes in circulation. Here, we explore the effect of similar but artificially induced forcings that mimic natural radiative perturbations in order to stabilize surface climate. Injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, not unlike the effects from large volcanic eruptions, and a direct reduction of insolation, similar to total solar irradiance changes, are tested in their effectiveness to offset global mean temperature rise resulting from a business-as-usual scenario, thereby reducing surface temperatures to conditions associated with committed warming of a year 2000 stabilization scenario. This study uses a coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model to illustrate the character of resulting climate and circulation anomalies when both enhanced greenhouse (A2 scenario) and opposing geoengineering perturbations are considered. First we quantify the magnitude of the required perturbation and compare these artificial perturbations to the natural range of the respective forcing. Then, we test the effectiveness of the ""correction"" by looking at the regional climate response to the combined forcing. It is shown that widespread warming could be reduced, but overcompensation in the tropics is necessary because sea ice loss in high latitudes cannot be reversed effectively to overcome higher ocean heat content and enhanced zonal winter circulation as well as the continuous IR forcing. The magnitude of new, greenhouse gas-countering anthropogenic forcing would have to be much larger than what natural forcing from volcanoes and solar irradiance variability commonly provide."	0148-0227		NOV 19	2010	115							D22109	10.1029/2009JD012878

Simulations of the response of mesospheric circulation and temperature to the Antarctic ozone hole	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"The loss of ozone that has occurred in the Antarctic lower stratosphere during each spring since 1980 has led to a decrease in the lower stratospheric temperature that persists into the summer season. The temperature changes are accompanied by changes in the zonal wind in the SH stratosphere that affect the filtering of gravity waves propagating into the mesosphere. In simulations with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), the resulting gravity wave changes have led to a weakening of the SH summer upwelling around 65-80 km and of the equatorward flow around 0.01 hPa. The trend occurs primarily in the years 1975-1990. The circulation changes are accompanied by an increase in the SH temperature at 65-85 km and a decrease at 95 km. Comparison of the summer temperatures in the NH and SH indicates a distinctive offset beginning around 1980.

To mitigate these deficiencies, five model modifications are tested to improve snowpack performance: (1) time-varying snow albedo, (2) solar radiation adjustment for terrain slope and orientation, (3) reducing the surface exchange coefficient for stable boundary layers, (4) increase of fresh snow albedo, and (5) adjusting surface roughness length when snow is present. The Noah LSM is executed from 1 November 2007 to 1 August 2008 for the headwater region in the Colorado Rocky Mountains with complex terrain, and its results are evaluated against 1 km Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) output and individual Natural Resources Conservation Service Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites. The most effective way to improve magnitude and timing of seasonal maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) is the introduction of the time-varying albedo formulation and the increase in fresh snow albedo. Minor improvement is obtained by reducing nighttime sublimation through adjusting the stable boundary layer surface exchange coefficient. Modifying the surface roughness length over snow surfaces and adding a terrain slope and orientation adjustment for radiation has little effect on average SWE conditions for the entire modeling domain, though it can have a significant effect in certain regions. The net effect of all changes is to improve the magnitude and timing of seasonal maximum SWE, but the snow period end is now somewhat too long. Adding the terrain slope and orientation effects does have an effect on local surface energy flux components depending on the cell slope and orientation."	0148-0227		NOV 16	2010	115							D22101	10.1029/2009JD013470

Enhanced nutrient supply to the California Current ecosystem with global warming and increased stratification in an earth system model	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"A leading hypothesis relating productivity with climate variability in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) describes an alternation between warmer, well-stratified periods of low productivity and cooler periods of high productivity. This empirical relationship suggests that productivity will decline with global warming. Here, we explore the response of productivity to future climate change in the CCE using an earth system model. This model projects increases in nitrate supply and productivity in the CCE during the 21st century despite increases in stratification and limited change in wind-driven upwelling. We attribute the increased nitrate supply to enrichment of deep source waters entering the CCE resulting from decreased ventilation of the North Pacific. Decreases in dissolved-oxygen concentration and increasing acidification accompany projected increases in nitrate. This analysis illustrates that anthropogenic climate change may be unlike past variability; empirical relationships based on historical observations may be inappropriate for projecting ecosystem responses to future climate change.

A precise asteroseismic age and radius for the evolved Sun-like star KIC 11026764	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"The primary science goal of the Kepler Mission is to provide a census of exoplanets in the solar neighborhood, including the identification and characterization of habitable Earth-like planets. The asteroseismic capabilities of the mission are being used to determine precise radii and ages for the target stars from their solar-like oscillations. Chaplin et al. published observations of three bright G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5 days of science operations. One of these stars, the subgiant KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived asteroseismic estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from Kepler photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of KIC 11026764 with a precision near 1%, and an accuracy near 2% for the radius and 15% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination of its fundamental properties."	0004-637X		NOV 10	2010	723	2				1583	1598		10.1088/0004-637X/723/2/1583

Asteroseismology of red giants from the first four months of Kepler data: Global oscillation parameters for 800 stars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"We have studied solar-like oscillations in similar to 800 red giant stars using Kepler long-cadence photometry. The sample includes stars ranging in evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency separation (Delta nu) and the frequency of maximum power (nu(max)) and show that it is different for red giants than for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models and scaling relations. The distributions of nu(max) and Delta nu are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a secondary clump population characterized by M greater than or similar to 2M(circle dot) and nu(max) similar or equal to 40-110 mu Hz. We measured the small frequency separations delta nu(02) and delta nu(01) in over 400 stars and delta nu(03) in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation ratios delta nu(02)/Delta nu and delta nu(01)/Delta nu have opposite trends as a function of Delta nu The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward lower nu(max), in agreement with models predicting more efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset is an element of in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with.., demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first amplitude-nu(max) relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a lack of low-amplitude stars for nu(max) greater than or similar to 110 mu Hz and find that, for a given nu(max) between 40 and 110 mu Hz, stars with lower Delta nu (and consequently higher mass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher Delta nu."	0004-637X		NOV 10	2010	723	2				1607	1617		10.1088/0004-637X/723/2/1607

Our estimate lies within a factor of two of the energy flux needed to balance radiative losses from the chromosphere according to the estimates of Anderson & Athay and revives interest in acoustic waves for transporting energy to the chromosphere.

Fully resolved quiet-Sun magnetic flux tube observed with the SUNRISE/IMaX instrument	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"Until today, the small size of magnetic elements in quiet-Sun areas has required the application of indirect methods, such as the line-ratio technique or multi-component inversions, to infer their physical properties. A consistent match to the observed Stokes profiles could only be obtained by introducing a magnetic filling factor that specifies the fraction of the observed pixel filled with magnetic field. Here, we investigate the properties of a small magnetic patch in the quiet Sun observed with the IMaX magnetograph on board the balloon-borne telescope Sunrise with unprecedented spatial resolution and low instrumental stray light. We apply an inversion technique based on the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve the temperature stratification and the field strength in the magnetic patch. The observations can be well reproduced with a one-component, fully magnetized atmosphere with a field strength exceeding 1 kG and a significantly enhanced temperature in the mid to upper photosphere with respect to its surroundings, consistent with semi-empirical flux tube models for plage regions. We therefore conclude that, within the framework of a simple atmospheric model, the IMaX measurements resolve the observed quiet-Sun flux tube."	2041-8205		NOV 10	2010	723	2				L164	L168		10.1088/2041-8205/723/2/L164

BP contrasts have been measured between 214 nm and 525 nm, including the first measurements at wavelengths below 388 nm. The histograms of the BP peak brightness show a clear trend toward broader contrast distributions and higher mean contrasts at shorter wavelengths. At 214 nm, we observe a peak brightness of up to five times the mean quiet-Sun value, the highest BP contrast so far observed.

We find that granules frequently show substructure in the form of lanes composed of a leading bright rim and a trailing dark edge, which move together from the boundary of a granule into the granule itself. We find strikingly similar events in synthesized intensity maps from an ab initio numerical simulation of solar surface convection. From cross sections through the computational domain of the simulation, we conclude that these granular lanes are the visible signature of (horizontally oriented) vortex tubes. The characteristic optical appearance of vortex tubes at the solar surface is explained.

We find that most magnetic loops that reach into the chromosphere or higher have one footpoint in relatively strong magnetic field regions in the photosphere. Ninety-one percent of the magnetic energy in the mid-chromosphere (at a height of 1 Mm) is in field lines, whose stronger footpoint has a strength of more than 300 G, i.e., above the equipartition field strength with convection. The loops reaching into the chromosphere and corona are also found to be asymmetric in the sense that the weaker footpoint has a strength B < 300 G and is located in the internetwork (IN). Such loops are expected to be strongly dynamic and have short lifetimes, as dictated by the properties of the IN fields."	2041-8205		NOV 10	2010	723	2				L185	L189		10.1088/2041-8205/723/2/L185

Discovery of a 1.6 year magentic activity cycle in the exoplanet host star iota Horologii	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"The Mount Wilson Ca HK survey revealed magnetic activity variations in a large sample of solar-type stars with timescales ranging from 2.5 to 25 years. This broad range of cycle periods is thought to reflect differences in the rotational properties and the depths of the surface convection zones for stars with various masses and ages. In 2007, we initiated a long-term monitoring campaign of Ca II H and K emission for a sample of 57 southern solar-type stars to measure their magnetic activity cycles and their rotational properties when possible. We report the discovery of a 1.6 year magnetic activity cycle in the exoplanet host star iota Horologii and obtain an estimate of the rotation period that is consistent with Hyades membership. This is the shortest activity cycle so far measured for a solar-type star and may be related to the short-timescale magnetic variations recently identified in the Sun and HD 49933 from helioseismic and asteroseismic measurements.

Where the granular flows bend	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"Based on IMaX/SUNRISE data, we report on a previously undetected phenomenon in solar granulation. We show that in a very narrow region separating granules and intergranular lanes, the spectral line width of the Fe I 5250.2 angstrom line becomes extremely small. We offer an explanation of this observation with the help of magneto-convection simulations. These regions with extremely small line widths correspond to the places where the granular flows bend from upflow in granules to downflow in intergranular lanes. We show that the resolution and image stability achieved by IMaX/SUNRISE are important requisites to detect this interesting phenomenon."	2041-8205		NOV 10	2010	723	2				L159	L163		10.1088/2041-8205/723/2/L159

Surface waves in solar granulation observed with SUNRISE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"Solar oscillations are expected to be excited by turbulent flows in the intergranular lanes near the solar surface. Time series recorded by the IMaX instrument on board the Sunrise observatory reveal solar oscillations at high spatial resolution, which allow the study of the properties of oscillations with short wavelengths. We analyze two time series with synchronous recordings of Doppler velocity and continuum intensity images with durations of 32 minutes and 23 minutes, respectively, recorded close to the disk center of the Sun to study the propagation and excitation of solar acoustic oscillations. In the Doppler velocity data, both the standing acoustic waves and the short-lived, high-degree running waves are visible. The standing waves are visible as temporary enhancements of the amplitudes of the large-scale velocity field due to the stochastic superposition of the acoustic waves. We focus on the high-degree small-scale waves by suitable filtering in the Fourier domain. Investigating the propagation and excitation of f- and p(1)-modes with wavenumbers k > 1.4 Mm(-1), we also find that exploding granules contribute to the excitation of solar p-modes in addition to the contribution of intergranular lanes."	2041-8205		NOV 10	2010	723	2				L175	L179		10.1088/2041-8205/723/2/L175

An estimate of the detectability of rising flux tubes	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"The physics of the formation of magnetic active regions (ARs) is one of the most important problems in solar physics. One main class of theories suggests that ARs are the result of magnetic flux that rises from the tachocline. Time-distance helioseismology, which is based on measurements of wave propagation, promises to allow the study of the subsurface behavior of this magnetic flux. Here, we use a model for a buoyant magnetic flux concentration together with the ray approximation to show that the dominant effect on the wave propagation is expected to be from the roughly 100 m s(-1) retrograde flow associated with the rising flux. Using a B-spline-based method for carrying out inversions of wave travel times for flows in spherical geometry, we show that at 3 days before emergence the detection of this retrograde flow at a depth of 30 Mm should be possible with a signal-to-noise level of about 8 with a sample of 150 emerging ARs."	2041-8205		NOV 10	2010	723	2				L190	L194		10.1088/2041-8205/723/2/L190

MODIS fire counts put the source as the burning of agricultural waste after harvest season in the Nile delta region. Synchronous MISR data show that these fires create low altitude (< 500 m) plumes of smoke and aerosols which flow over Cairo in a few hours, as confirmed by Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) forward trajectory analyses. Much of the burning occurs at night, when an inversion constrains the plumes to remain in the boundary layer (BL).

The model qualitatively reproduces the observed diurnal and latitude variations of the geomagnetic horizontal intensity and declination for the reference quiet day in midlatitude and low-latitude regions but underestimates their amplitudes. The patterns of the disturbance dynamo signature and its source ""anti-Sq"" current system are well reproduced in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the model significantly underestimates the amplitude of disturbance dynamo effects when compared with observations. Furthermore, the largest simulated disturbances occur at different local times than the observations.

Climate impacts of parameterized Nordic Sea overflows	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS									"A new overflow parameterization (OFP) of density-driven flows through ocean ridges via narrow, unresolved channels has been developed and implemented in the ocean component of the Community Climate System Model version 4. It represents exchanges from the Nordic Seas and the Antarctic shelves, associated entrainment, and subsequent injection of overflow product waters into the abyssal basins. We investigate the effects of the parameterized Denmark Strait (DS) and Faroe Bank Channel (FBC) overflows on the ocean circulation, showing their impacts on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the North Atlantic climate. The OFP is based on the Marginal Sea Boundary Condition scheme of Price and Yang (1998), but there are significant differences that are described in detail. Two uncoupled (ocean-only) and two fully coupled simulations are analyzed. Each pair consists of one case with the OFP and a control case without this parameterization. In both uncoupled and coupled experiments, the parameterized DS and FBC source volume transports are within the range of observed estimates. The entrainment volume transports remain lower than observational estimates, leading to lower than observed product volume transports. Due to low entrainment, the product and source water properties are too similar. The DS and FBC overflow temperature and salinity properties are in better agreement with observations in the uncoupled case than in the coupled simulation, likely reflecting surface flux differences. The most significant impact of the OFP is the improved North Atlantic Deep Water penetration depth, leading to a much better comparison with the observational data and significantly reducing the chronic, shallow penetration depth bias in level coordinate models. This improvement is due to the deeper penetration of the southward flowing Deep Western Boundary Current. In comparison with control experiments without the OFP, the abyssal ventilation rates increase in the North Atlantic. In the uncoupled simulation with the OFP, the warm bias of the control simulation in the deep North Atlantic is substantially reduced along with salinity bias reductions in the northern North Atlantic. There are similar but more modest bias reductions in the deep temperature and salinity distributions especially in the northern North Atlantic in the coupled OFP case. In coupled simulations, there are noticeable impacts of the OFP on climate. The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer by more than 5 C off the North American coast and by more than 1 C in the Nordic Sea with the OFP. The surface heat fluxes mostly act to diminish these SST changes. There are related changes in the sea level pressure, leading to about 15% weaker westerly wind stress in the northern North Atlantic. In response to the warmer Nordic Sea SSTs, there are reductions in the sea ice extent, improving comparisons with observations. Although the OFP cases improve many aspects of the simulations compared to observations, some significant biases remain, more in coupled than in uncoupled simulations."	0148-0227		NOV 6	2010	115							C11005	10.1029/2010JC006243

Chemistry-climate model simulations of spring Antarctic ozone	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Coupled chemistry-climate model simulations covering the recent past and continuing throughout the 21st century have been completed with a range of different models. Common forcings are used for the halogen amounts and greenhouse gas concentrations, as expected under the Montreal Protocol (with amendments) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1b Scenario. The simulations of the Antarctic ozone hole are compared using commonly used diagnostics: the minimum ozone, the maximum area of ozone below 220 DU, and the ozone mass deficit below 220 DU. Despite the fact that the processes responsible for ozone depletion are reasonably well understood, a wide range of results is obtained. Comparisons with observations indicate that one of the reasons for the model underprediction in ozone hole area is the tendency for models to underpredict, by up to 35%, the area of low temperatures responsible for polar stratospheric cloud formation. Models also typically have species gradients that are too weak at the edge of the polar vortex, suggesting that there is too much mixing of air across the vortex edge. Other models show a high bias in total column ozone which restricts the size of the ozone hole (defined by a 220 DU threshold). The results of those models which agree best with observations are examined in more detail. For several models the ozone hole does not disappear this century but a small ozone hole of up to three million square kilometers continues to occur in most springs even after 2070."	0148-0227		NOV 5	2010	115							D00M11	10.1029/2009JD013577

Seasonal and hemispheric variations of the total auroral precipitation energy flux from TIMED/GUVI	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"[1] The auroral hemispheric power (HP) has been calculated from the averaged energy flux derived from Far-ultraviolet emission observations made by the global ultraviolet imager (GUVI) instrument on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite during 2002-2007. This HP was used to study how variations in seasonal and hemispheric asymmetries changed with changing geomagnetic activity. Our results showed that there were persistent seasonal and hemispheric differences in quiet conditions. There were HP differences of about 1-3 GW between the summer and winter seasons in each hemisphere and also between the two hemispheres during each solstice period for low geomagnetic activity (Kp <= 3). The summer-winter asymmetry was 4%-35% when HP was low. These summer-winter differences became negligible when geomagnetic activity was moderate to active. Similarly, there were also HP differences of about 2 GW between local summers of the two hemispheres during geomagnetically quiet conditions (Kp < 3) but not during higher Kp conditions. The hemispheric asymmetries between the two summer solstices were about 10%-20% during quiet conditions, whereas there was no apparent hemispheric asymmetry between the two winter solstices under all Kp 1-5 conditions. Solar illumination effects were probably the primary cause of the seasonal and hemispheric variations of the auroral hemispheric power for these geomagnetically quiet conditions. During moderate and active conditions the conductivities were driven more by the production of ionization due to precipitation, so the precipitation was more symmetric."	0148-0227		NOV 5	2010	115							A11304	10.1029/2009JA015063

Laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up-regulation of various stress-related genes, leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding.

Decline and recovery of total column ozone using a multimodel time series analysis	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"[1] Simulations of 15 coupled chemistry climate models, for the period 1960-2100, are presented. The models include a detailed stratosphere, as well as including a realistic representation of the tropospheric climate. The simulations assume a consistent set of changing greenhouse gas concentrations, as well as temporally varying chlorofluorocarbon concentrations in accordance with observations for the past and expectations for the future. The ozone results are analyzed using a nonparametric additive statistical model. Comparisons are made with observations for the recent past, and the recovery of ozone, indicated by a return to 1960 and 1980 values, is investigated as a function of latitude. Although chlorine amounts are simulated to return to 1980 values by about 2050, with only weak latitudinal variations, column ozone amounts recover at different rates due to the influence of greenhouse gas changes. In the tropics, simulated peak ozone amounts occur by about 2050 and thereafter total ozone column declines. Consequently, simulated ozone does not recover to values which existed prior to the early 1980s. The results also show a distinct hemispheric asymmetry, with recovery to 1980 values in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics ahead of the chlorine return by about 20 years. In the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, ozone is simulated to return to 1980 levels only 10 years ahead of chlorine. In the Antarctic, annually averaged ozone recovers at about the same rate as chlorine in high latitudes and hence does not return to 1960s values until the last decade of the simulations."	0148-0227		NOV 4	2010	115							D00M10	10.1029/2010JD013857

These include dropsondes deployed from four aircrafts and zero-pressure balloons in the stratosphere (NCAR's Driftsonde system). The water vapor probability distribution and spatial variability in the northern subtropical Pacific (14 degrees-20 degrees N, 140 degrees E-155 degrees W) are studied using Driftsonde and COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) data and four global reanalysis products. Driftsonde data analysis shows distinct differences of relative humidity (RH) distributions in the free troposphere between the Eastern and Western Pacific (EP and WP, defined as east and west of 180, respectively), very dry with a single peak of similar to 1% RH in the EP and bi-modal distributions in the WP with one peak near ice saturation and one varying with altitude. The frequent occurrences of extreme dry air are found in the driftsonde data with 59% and 19% of RHs less than or equal to 5% and at 1% at 500 hPa in the EP, respectively. RH with respect to ice in the free troposphere exhibits considerable longitudinal variations, very low (<20%) in the EP, but varying from 20% to 100% in the WP. Inter-comparisons of Driftsonde, COSMIC and reanalysis data show generally good agreement among the Driftsonde, COSMIC, ECMWF Reanalysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and Japanese Reanalysis (JRA) below 200 hPa. The ERA-Interim and JRA are approved to be successful on describing RH frequency distributions and spatial variations in the region. The comparisons also reveal problems in Driftsonde, two National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses and COSMIC data. The moist layer at 200-100 hPa in the WP shown in the ERA-Interim, JRA and COSMIC is missing in Driftsonde data. Major problems are found in the RH means and variability over the study region for both NCEP reanalyses. Although the higher-moisture layer at 200-100 hPa in the WP in the COSMIC data agrees well with the ERA-Interim and JRA, it is primarily attributed to the first guess of the 1-Dimensional (1D) variational analysis used in the COSMIC retrieval rather than the refractivity measurements. The limited soundings (total 268) of Driftsonde data are capable of portraying RH probability distributions and longitudinal variability. This implies that Driftsonde system has the potential to become a valuable operational system for upper air observations over the ocean."	0148-0227		NOV 4	2010	115							D21108	10.1029/2010JD014494

A new interpretation of total column BrO during Arctic spring	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Emission of bromine from sea-salt aerosol, frost flowers, ice leads, and snow results in the nearly complete removal of surface ozone during Arctic spring. Regions of enhanced total column BrO observed by satellites have traditionally been associated with these emissions. However, airborne measurements of BrO and O(3) within the convective boundary layer (CBL) during the ARCTAS and ARCPAC field campaigns at times bear little relation to enhanced column BrO. We show that the locations of numerous satellite BrO ""hotspots"" during Arctic spring are consistent with observations of total column ozone and tropopause height, suggesting a stratospheric origin to these regions of elevated BrO. Tropospheric enhancements of BrO large enough to affect the column abundance are also observed, with important contributions originating from above the CBL. Closure of the budget for total column BrO, albeit with significant uncertainty, is achieved by summing observed tropospheric partial columns with calculated stratospheric partial columns provided that natural, short-lived biogenic bromocarbons supply between 5 and 10 ppt of bromine to the Arctic lowermost stratosphere. Proper understanding of bromine and its effects on atmospheric composition requires accurate treatment of geographic variations in column BrO originating from both the stratosphere and troposphere.

Modeling hydrologic and water quality extremes in a changing climate: A statistical approach based on extreme value theory	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH									"[1] Although information about climate change and its implications is becoming increasingly available to water utility managers, additional tools are needed to translate this information into secondary products useful for local assessments. The anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle makes quantifying changes to hydrologic extremes, as well as associated water quality effects, of particular concern. To this end, this paper focuses on using extreme value statistics to describe maximum monthly flow distributions at a given site, where the nonstationarity is derived from concurrent climate information. From these statistics, flow quantiles are reconstructed over the historic record and then projected to 2100. This paper extends this analysis to an associated source water quality impact, whereby the corresponding risk of exceeding a water quality threshold is examined. The approach is applied to a drinking water source in the Pacific Northwest United States that has experienced elevated turbidity values correlated with high streamflow. Results demonstrate that based on climate change information from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report, the variability and magnitude of extreme streamflows substantially increase over the 21st century. Consequently, the likelihood of a turbidity exceedance increases, as do the associated relative costs. The framework is general and could be applied to estimate extreme streamflow under climate change at other locations, with straightforward extensions to other water quality variables that depend on extreme hydroclimate."	0043-1397		NOV 3	2010	46							W11504	10.1029/2009WR008876

On spontaneous formation of current sheets: Untwisted magnetic fields	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS									"This is a study of the spontaneous formation of electric current sheets in an incompressible viscous fluid with perfect electrical conductivity, governed by the magnetohydrodynamic Navier-Stokes equations Numerical solutions to two initial value problems are presented for a three-dimensional, periodic, untwisted magnetic field evolving, with no change in magnetic topology under the frozen-in condition and at characteristic fluid Reynolds numbers of the order of 500, from a nonequilibrium initial state with the fluid at rest The evolution converts magnetic free energy into kinetic energy to be all dissipated away by viscosity so that the field settles into a minimum-energy, static equilibrium The solutions demonstrate that, as a consequence of the frozen-in condition, current sheets must form during the evolution despite the geometric simplicity of the prescribed initial fields In addition to the current sheets associated with magnetic neutral points and field reversal layers, other sheets not associated with such magnetic features are also in evidence These current sheets form on magnetic flux surfaces This property is used to achieve a high degree of the frozen-in condition in the simulations, by describing the magnetic field entirely in terms of the advection of its flux surfaces and integrating the resulting governing equations with a customized version of a general-purpose high-resolution (viz, nonoscillatory) hydrodynamical simulation code EULAG [J M Prusa et al, Comput Fluids 37, 1193 (2008)] Incompressibility imposes the additional global constraint that the flux surfaces must evolve with no change in the spatial volumes they enclose In this approach, current sheet formation is demonstrated graphically by the progressive pressing together of suitably selected flux surfaces until their separation has diminished below the minimal resolved distance on a fixed grid The frozen-in condition then fails in the simulation as the field reconnects through an effecting numerical resistivity The principal results are related to the Parker theory of current-sheet formation and dissipation in the solar corona (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics [doi:10.1063/1.3496379]"	1070-664X		NOV	2010	17	11						112901	10.1063/1.3496379

A simple technique for creating regional composites of sea surface temperature from MODIS for use in operational mesoscale NWP	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY									"This paper describes a simple technique for creating regional, high-resolution, daytime and nighttime composites of sea surface temperature (SST) for use in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP). The composites are based on observations from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua and Terra. The data used typically are available nearly in real time, are applicable anywhere on the globe, and are capable of roughly representing the diurnal cycle in SST. The composites' resolution is much higher than that of many other standard SST products used for operational NWP, including the low-and high-resolution Real-Time Global (RTG) analyses. The difference in resolution is key because several studies have shown that highly resolved SSTs are important for driving the air-sea interactions that shape patterns of static stability, vertical and horizontal wind shear, and divergence in the planetary boundary layer. The MODIS-based composites are compared to in situ observations from buoys and other platforms operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) off the coasts of New England, the mid-Atlantic, and Florida. Mean differences, mean absolute differences, and root-mean-square differences between the composites and the NDBC observations are all within tenths of a degree of those calculated between RTG analyses and the NDBC observations. This is true whether or not one accounts for the mean offset between the skin temperatures of the MODIS dataset and the bulk temperatures of the NDBC observations and RTG analyses. Near the coast, the MODIS-based composites tend to agree more with NDBC observations than do the RTG analyses. The opposite is true away from the coast. All of these differences in point-wise comparisons among the SST datasets are small compared to the +/- 1.0 degrees C accuracy of the NDBC SST sensors. Because skin-temperature variations from land to water so strongly affect the development and life cycle of the sea breeze, this phenomenon was chosen for demonstrating the use of the MODIS-based composite in an NWP model. A simulated sea breeze in the vicinity of New York City and Long Island shows a small, net, but far from universal improvement when MODIS-based composites are used in place of RTG analyses. The timing of the sea breeze's arrival is more accurate at some stations, and the near-surface temperature, wind, and humidity within the breeze are more realistic."	1558-8424		NOV	2010	49	11				2267	2284		10.1175/2010JAMC2430.1

During the special observing period of TiMREX (from 15 May to 25 June 2008), 2330 radiosonde observations were successfully taken from the enhanced network. Part of the challenge of processing the data from the 13 upsonde sites is that four different sonde types (Vaisala RS80, Vaisala RS92, Meisei, and Graw) were used. Post-field phase analyses of the sonde data revealed a significant dry bias in many of the sondes-in particular, in the data from the Vaisala RS80 sondes that were used at four sites. In addition, contamination of the sonde data by the ship's structure resulted in poor-quality low-level thermodynamic data at a key oceanic site. This article examines the methods used to quality control the sonde data and, when possible, to correct them. Particular attention is given to the correction of the humidity field and its impact on various convective measures. Comparison of the corrected sonde humidity data with independent estimates shows good agreement, suggesting that the corrections were effective in removing many of the sonde humidity errors. Examining various measures of convection shows that use of the humidity-corrected sondes gives a much different perspective on the characteristics of convection during TiMREX. For example, at the RS80 sites, use of the corrected humidity data increases the mean CAPE by similar to 500 J kg(-1), decreases mean convective inhibition (CIN) by 80 J kg(-1), and increases the midlevel convective mass flux by greater than 70%. Ultimately, these corrections will provide more accurate moisture fields for diagnostic analyses and modeling studies."	0739-0572		NOV	2010	27	11				1802	1821		10.1175/2010JTECHA1481.1

Methods: The study included 2,589 incident primary melanoma patients with assessment of histologic solar elastosis in the population-based Genes, Environment, and Melanoma study. Ambient erythemal UV (UVE) at places of residence and sun exposure hours, including body site-specific exposure, were collected. We examined the association of cumulative site-specific and non-site-specific sun exposure hours and ambient UVE with solar elastosis in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, center, pigmentary characteristics, nevi, and, where relevant, body site. Results: Solar elastosis was associated most strongly with site-specific UVE [odds ratio (OR) for top exposure quartile, 5.20; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.40-7.96; P for trend <0.001] and also with site-specific sun exposure (OR for top quartile, 5.12; 95% CI, 3.35-7.83; P for trend <0.001). Older age (OR at >70 years, 7.69; 95% CI, 5.14-11.52; P for trend <0.001) and having more than 10 back nevi (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.97; P = 0.03) were independently associated with solar elastosis. Conclusion: Solar elastosis had a strong association with higher site-specific UVE dose, older age, and fewer nevi. Impact: Solar elastosis could be a useful biomarker of lifetime site-specific UV. Future research is needed to explore whether age represents more than simple accumulation of sun exposure and to determine why people with more nevi may be less prone to solar elastosis.

Enhanced ozone over western North America from biomass burning in Eurasia during April 2008 as seen in surface and profile observations	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"During April 2008, as part of the International Polar Year (IPY), a number of ground-based and aircraft campaigns were carried out in the North American Arctic region (e.g., ARCTAS, ARCPAC). The widespread presence during this period of biomass burning effluent, both gaseous and particulate, has been reported. Unusually high ozone readings for this time of year were recorded at surface ozone monitoring sites from northern Alaska to northern California. At Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost point in the United States, the highest April ozone readings recorded at the surface (hourly average values >55 ppbv) in 37 years of observation were measured on April 19, 2008. At Denali National Park in central Alaska, an hourly average of 79 ppbv was recorded during an 8-h period in which the average was over 75 ppbv, exceeding the ozone ambient air quality standard threshold value in the U.S. Elevated ozone (>60 ppbv) persisted almost continuously from April 19-23 at the monitoring site during this event. At a coastal site in northern California (Trinidad Head), hourly ozone readings were >50 ppbv almost continuously for a 35-h period from April 18-20. At several sites in northern California, located to the east of Trinidad Head, numerous occurrences of ozone readings exceeding 60 ppbv were recorded during April 2008. Ozone profiles from an extensive series of balloon soundings showed lower tropospheric features at similar to 1-6 km with enhanced ozone during the times of elevated ozone amounts at surface sites in western Canada and the U.S. Based on extensive trajectory calculations, biomass burning in regions of southern Russia was identified as the likely source of the observed ozone enhancements. Ancillary measurements of atmospheric constituents and optical properties (aerosol optical thickness) supported the presence of a burning plume at several locations. At two coastal sites (Trinidad Head and Vancouver Island), profiles of a large suite of gases were measured from airborne flask samples taken during probable encounters with burning plumes. These profiles aided in characterizing the vertical thickness of the plumes, as well as confirming that the plumes reaching the west coast of North America were associated with biomass burning events.

ARCTAS Sci Team	Pollution influences on atmospheric composition and chemistry at high northern latitudes: Boreal and California forest fire emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"We analyze detailed atmospheric gas/aerosol composition data acquired during the 2008 NASA ARCTAS (Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites) airborne campaign performed at high northern latitudes in spring (ARCTAS-A) and summer (ARCTAS-B) and in California in summer (ARCTAS-CARB). Biomass burning influences were widespread throughout the ARCTAS campaign. MODIS data from 2000 to 2009 indicated that 2008 had the second largest fire counts over Siberia and a more normal Canadian boreal forest fire season. Near surface arctic air in spring contained strong anthropogenic signatures indicated by high sulfate. In both spring and summer most of the pollution plumes transported to the Arctic region were from Europe and Asia and were present in the mid to upper troposphere and contained a mix of forest fire and urban influences. The gas/aerosol composition of the high latitude troposphere was strongly perturbed at all altitudes in both spring and summer. The reactive nitrogen budget was balanced with PAN as the dominant component. Mean ozone concentrations in the high latitude troposphere were only minimally perturbed (<5 ppb), although many individual pollution plumes sampled in the mid to upper troposphere, and mixed with urban influences, contained elevated ozone (Delta O(3)/Delta CO = 0.11 +/- 0.09 v/v). Emission and optical characteristics of boreal and California wild fires were quantified and found to be broadly comparable. Greenhouse gas emission estimates derived from ARCTAS-CARB data for the South Coast Air Basin of California show good agreement with state inventories for CO(2) and N(2)O but indicate substantially larger emissions of CH(4). Simulations by multiple models of transport and chemistry were found to be broadly consistent with observations with a tendency towards under prediction at high latitudes.

Extended-range probabilistic forecasts of Ganges and Brahmaputra floods in Bangladesh	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY									"The authors have developed a new extended-range flood forecasting system for large river basins that uses satellite data and statistically rendered probabilistic weather and climate predictions to initialize basin-scale hydrological models. The forecasting system overcomes the absence of upstreamflow data, a problem that is prevalent in the developing world. Forecasts of the Ganges and Brahmaputra discharge into Bangladesh were made in real time on 1-10-day time horizons for the period 2003-08. Serious flooding of the Brahmaputra occurred in 2004, 2007, and 2008. Detailed forecasts of the flood onset and withdrawal were made 10 days in advance for each of the flooding events with correlations at 10 days >= 0.8 and Brier scores <0.05. Extensions to 15 days show useable skill. Based on the 1-10-day forecasts of the 2007 and 2008 floods, emergency managers in Bangladesh were able to act preemptively, arrange the evacuation of populations in peril along the Brahmaputra, and minimize financial loss. The particular application of this forecast scheme in Bangladesh represents a ""world is flat"" approach to emergency management through the collaboration of scientists in Europe (generating global ensemble meteorological and climate forecasts), the United States (developing and producing the integrated flood forecasts), and the developing world (integrating the flood forecasts into their disaster management decision-making protocol), all enabled by high-speed Internet connections. We also make suggestions of how scientific and technical collaborations between more developed and developing nations can be improved to increase their prospects for sustaining the technology adoption and transfer."	0003-0007		NOV	2010	91	11				1493	U121		10.1175/2010BAMS2911.1

Asteroseismology of red giants from the first four months of Kepler data: Fundamental stellar parameters	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS									"Clear power excess in a frequency range typical for solar-type oscillations in red giants has been detected in more than 1000 stars, which have been observed during the first 138 days of the science operation of the NASA Kepler satellite. This sample includes stars in a wide mass and radius range with spectral types G and K, extending in luminosity from the bottom of the giant branch up to high-luminous red giants, including the red bump and clump. The high-precision asteroseismic observations with Kepler provide a perfect source for testing stellar structure and evolutionary models, as well as investigating the stellar population in our Galaxy. Aims. We aim to extract accurate seismic parameters from the Kepler time series and use them to infer asteroseismic fundamental parameters from scaling relations and a comparison with red-giant models. Methods. We fit a global model to the observed power density spectra, which allows us to accurately estimate the granulation background signal and the global oscillation parameters, such as the frequency of maximum oscillation power. We find regular patterns of radial and non-radial oscillation modes and use a new technique to automatically identify the mode degree and the characteristic frequency separations between consecutive modes of the same spherical degree. In most cases, we can also measure the small separation between l = 0, 1, and 2 modes. Subsequently, the seismic parameters are used to estimate stellar masses and radii and to place the stars in an H-R diagram by using an extensive grid of stellar models that covers a wide parameter range. Using Bayesian techniques throughout our entire analysis allows us to determine reliable uncertainties for all parameters. Results. We provide accurate seismic parameters and their uncertainties for a large sample of red giants and determine their asteroseismic fundamental parameters. We investigate the influence of the stars' metallicities on their positions in the H-R diagram. Finally, we study the red-giant populations in the red clump and bump and compare them to a synthetic population. We find a mass and metallicity gradient in the red clump and clear evidence of a secondary-clump population."	0004-6361		NOV	2010	522							A1	10.1051/0004-6361/201015263

Rapid mixed layer deepening by the combination of Langmuir and shear istabilities: A case study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY									"Langmuir circulation (LC) is a turbulent upper-ocean process driven by wind and surface waves that contributes significantly to the transport of momentum, heat, and mass in the oceanic surface layer. The authors have previously performed a direct comparison of large-eddy simulations and observations of the upper-ocean response to a wind event with rapid mixed layer deepening. The evolution of simulated crosswind velocity variance and spatial scales, as well as mixed layer deepening, was only consistent with observations if LC effects are included in the model. Based on an analysis of these validated simulations, in this study the fundamental differences in mixing between purely shear-driven turbulence and turbulence with LC are identified. In the former case, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production due to shear instabilities is largest near the surface, gradually decreasing to zero near the base of the mixed layer. This stands in contrast to the LC case in which at middepth range TKE production can be dominated by Stokes drift shear. Furthermore, the Eulerian mean vertical shear peaks near the base of the mixed layer so that TKE production by mean shear flow is elevated there. LC transports horizontal momentum efficiently downward leading to an along-wind velocity jet below LC downwelling regions at the base of the mixed layer. Locally enhanced vertical shear instabilities as a result of this jet efficiently erode the thermocline. In turn, enhanced breaking internal waves inject cold deep water into the mixed layer, where LC currents transport temperature perturbation advectively. Thus. LC and locally generated shear instabilities work intimately together to facilitate strongly the mixed layer deepening process."	0022-3670		NOV	2010	40	11				2381	2400		10.1175/2010JPO4403.1

Marshall"		Urbanization signature in the observed heavy rainfall climatology over India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY									"We assess the urbanization impacts on the heavy rainfall climatology during the Indian summer monsoon. While a number of studies have identified the impact of urbanization on local precipitation, a large-scale assessment has been lacking. This relation between urbanization and Indian monsoon rainfall changes is investigated by analyzing in situ and satellite-based precipitation and population datasets. Using a long-term daily rainfall dataset and high-resolution gridded analysis of human population, this study showed a significantly increasing trend in the frequency of heavy rainfall climatology over urban regions of India during the monsoon season. Urban regions experience less occurrences of light rainfall and significantly higher occurrences of intense precipitation compared to nonurban regions. Very heavy and extreme rainfall events showed increased trends over both urban and rural areas, but the trends over urban areas were larger and statistically more significant. Our analysis suggests that there is adequate statistical basis to conclude that the observed increasing trend in the frequency of heavy rainfall events over Indian monsoon region is more likely to be over regions where the pace of urbanization is faster. Moreover, rainfall measurements from satellites also indicate that urban areas are more (less) likely to experience heavier (lighter) precipitation rates compared to those in nonurban areas. While the mechanisms causing this enhancement in rainfall remain to be studied, the results provide the evidence that the increase in the heavy rainfall climatology over the Indian monsoon region is a signature of urban-induced rainfall anomaly.

Investigating the climate impacts of global land cover change in the community climate system model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY									"Recently, (Pitman et al., 2009) found a wide range of bio-geophysical climate impacts from historical land cover change when modelled in a suite of current global climate models (GCMs). The bio-geophysical climate impacts of human land cover change, however, have been investigated by a wide range of general circulation modelling, regional climate modelling, and observational studies. In this regard the IPCC 4th assessment report specifies radiative cooling of 0.2 W/m(2) as the dominant global impact of human land cover change since 1750, but states this has a low to medium level of scientific understanding. To further contribute to the understanding of the possible climatic impacts of anthropogenic land cover change, we have performed a series of land cover change experiments with the community land model (CLM) within the community climate system model (CCSM). To do this we have developed a new set of potential vegetation land surface parameters to represent land cover change in CLM. The new parameters are consistent with the potential vegetation biome mapping of (Ramankutty and Foley, 1999), with the plant functional types (PFTs) and plant phenology consistent with the current day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface parameters of (Lawrence and Chase, 2007). We found that land cover change in CCSM resulted in widespread regional warming of the near surface atmosphere, but with limited global impact on near surface temperatures. The experiments also found changes in precipitation, with drier conditions regionally, but with limited impact on average global precipitation. Analysis of the surface fluxes in the CCSM experiments found the current day warming was predominantly driven by changes in surface hydrology through reduced evapo-transpiration and latent heat flux, with the radiative forcing playing a secondary role. We show that these finding are supported by a wide range of observational field studies, satellite studies and regional and global climate modelling studies.

Ozone perturbation from medium-size asteroid impacts in the ocean	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS									"We present results of an investigation aimed at characterizing the effects of oceanic impacts of 500 in and 1 km diameter asteroids on the lower and middle atmosphere, estimating ozone loss and potential danger from UV radiation at the Earth's surface. Little work has been done so far to assess the atmospheric perturbation from the impact of objects in this size range, even though their sizes are close to the threshold for causing global environmental effects. In particular, at the Earth's surface oceanic impacts are twice more likely to occur than land impacts. This work represents the first attempt at combining impact simulations with a three-dimensional shock physics code (SOVA), and atmospheric simulations using the general circulation model with interactive chemistry WACCM. SOVA simulations provided an estimate of the amount and state of material ejected into the atmosphere by the impacts. Estimated water vapor in the upper atmosphere was then introduced in the initial conditions for the WACCM simulations that modeled the subsequent perturbation of atmospheric chemistry Final estimates of the change over time in UV flux at the surface due to the impact-induced ozone change are then carried out using the TUV radiative transfer model. The results suggest that mid-latitude oceanic impacts of 1 km asteroids can produce a significant, global perturbation of upper atmospheric chemistry, including multi-year global ozone depletion comparable to ozone hole records registered in the mid-1990 s. Asteroids 500 m in diameter cause limited perturbations of upper atmospheric chemistry with significant ozone depletion confined to the hemisphere in which the impact occurred. Impact-induced ozone depletion affects UV irradiance at the Earth's surface, resulting in levels of UV-B irradiance that can be dangerous for living organisms, and, in the tropics and initial midlatitude summers, far exceed levels currently experienced anywhere on Earth.

Modeling the subsurface structure of sunspots	SOLAR PHYSICS									"While sunspots are easily observed at the solar surface, determining their subsurface structure is not trivial. There are two main hypotheses for the subsurface structure of sunspots: the monolithic model and the cluster model. Local helioseismology is the only means by which we can investigate subphotospheric structure. However, as current linear inversion techniques do not yet allow helioseismology to probe the internal structure with sufficient confidence to distinguish between the monolith and cluster models, the development of physically realistic sunspot models are a priority for helioseismologists. This is because they are not only important indicators of the variety of physical effects that may influence helioseismic inferences in active regions, but they also enable detailed assessments of the validity of helioseismic interpretations through numerical forward modeling. In this article, we provide a critical review of the existing sunspot models and an overview of numerical methods employed to model wave propagation through model sunspots. We then carry out a helioseismic analysis of the sunspot in Active Region 9787 and address the serious inconsistencies uncovered by Gizon et al. (2009a, 2009b). We find that this sunspot is most probably associated with a shallow, positive wave-speed perturbation (unlike the traditional two-layer model) and that travel-time measurements are consistent with a horizontal outflow in the surrounding moat."	0038-0938		NOV	2010	267	1				1	62		10.1007/s11207-010-9630-4

For the statistical model several thousand predictors were used, comprising a large amount of historical upper-air data as well as data from the earth's surface. In the calibration period (1958-2001), the statistical models were fit using the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) as the predictand. After the weighting of the predictors, principal component (PC) analyses were performed on both the predictand and predictor dataset. Multiple linear regression models relate each principal component time series from the predictand with an optimal subset of principal component time series from the predictor. To assess the quality of the reconstructions, statistical split-sample validation (SSV) experiments were performed within the calibration period. Furthermore, the reconstructions were compared with independent historical upper-air and total ozone data. Based on the SSV experiment, this study obtained good reconstructions for temperature and GPH in the Northern Hemisphere; however, the skill in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere was much lower. The reconstruction skill shows a clear annual cycle with the highest values in January. The lower levels were better reconstructed except in the tropics where the highest levels showed the best skill. With the inclusion of a considerable amount of upper-air data after 1939 the skill increased substantially. The fields were analyzed for selected months in the 1920s and 1930s to demonstrate the usefulness of the reconstructions. It is shown that the reconstructions are able to capture regional-to-global dynamical features."	0894-8755		NOV	2010	23	21				5590	5609		10.1175/2010JCLI3056.1

Although positive trends in several global average quantities have been reported, no previous studies have documented broad intensification across elements of the Arctic freshwater cycle (FWC). In this study, the authors examine the character and quantitative significance of changes in annual precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge across the terrestrial pan-Arctic over the past several decades from observations and a suite of coupled general circulation models (GCMs). Trends in freshwater flux and storage derived from observations across the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas are also described. With few exceptions, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge fluxes from observations and the GCMs exhibit positive trends. Significant positive trends above the 90% confidence level, however, are not present for all of the observations. Greater confidence in the GCM trends arises through lower interannual variability relative to trend magnitude. Put another way, intrinsic variability in the observations tends to limit confidence in trend robustness. Ocean fluxes are less certain, primarily because of the lack of long-term observations. Where available, salinity and volume flux data suggest some decrease in saltwater inflow to the Barents Sea (i.e., a decrease in freshwater outflow) in recent decades. A decline in freshwater storage across the central Arctic Ocean and suggestions that large-scale circulation plays a dominant role in freshwater trends raise questions as to whether Arctic Ocean freshwater flows are intensifying. Although oceanic fluxes of freshwater are highly variable and consistent trends are difficult to verify, the other components of the Arctic FWC do show consistent positive trends over recent decades. The broad-scale increases provide evidence that the Arctic FWCis experiencing intensification. Efforts that aim to develop an adequate observation system are needed to reduce uncertainties and to detect and document ongoing changes in all system components for further evidence of Arctic FWC intensification."	0894-8755		NOV	2010	23	21				5715	5737		10.1175/2010JCLI3421.1

On one hand, SSV is strongly modulated by the ISO; that is, a strengthened (weakened) SSV appears during the enhanced (suppressed) ISO phase. The northwest-southeast-oriented synoptic wave train is strengthened and well organized in the northwestern Pacific during the enhanced ISO phase but weakened during the suppressed ISO phase. On the other hand, SSV may exert an upscale feedback to ISO through the nonlinearly rectified surface latent heat flux (LHF). The maximum synoptic contribution exceeds 20%-30% of the total intraseasonal LHF over the tropical Indian Ocean, western Pacific, and northeastern Pacific. The nonlinearly rectified LHF leads the ISO convection and boundary layer specific humidity, and thus it may contribute to the propagation of the ISO in boreal summer through the preconditioning of the surface moisture and moist static energy ahead of the convection."	0894-8755		NOV	2010	23	21				5738	5754		10.1175/2010JCLI3468.1

In particular, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the equatorial Pacific cold tongue are larger in magnitude during El Nino compared to La Nina, resulting in positive skewness of interannual SST variations. The associated atmospheric deep convection anomalies are displaced eastward during El Nino compared to La Nina because of the nonlinear atmospheric response to SST. In addition to these well-known features, an analysis of observational data for the past century shows that there is a robust asymmetry in the duration of El Nino and La Nina. Most El Ninos and La Ninas develop in late boreal spring/summer, when the climatological cold tongue is intensifying, and they peak near the end of the calendar year. After the mature phase, El Ninos tend to decay rapidly by next summer, but many La Ninas persist through the following year and often reintensify in the subsequent winter. Throughout the analysis period, this asymmetric feature is evident for strong events in which Nino-3.4 SST anomalies exceed one standard deviation in December. Seasonally stratified composite analysis suggests that the eastward displacement of atmospheric deep convection anomalies during El Nino enables surface winds in the western equatorial Pacific to be more affected by remote forcing from the Indian Ocean, which acts to terminate the Pacific events."	0894-8755		NOV	2010	23	21				5826	5843		10.1175/2010JCLI3592.1

Evaluating a new deposition velocity module in the Noah land-surface model	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY									"The community Noah land-surface model (Noah LSM) has been modified to couple with a photosynthesis-transpiration scheme (GEM) to estimate the deposition velocity (V(d)) for air quality studies. This new capability of the Noah-GEM model was tested in a point version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research-High Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS). Ozone V(d) observations from June 1-30, 2002 over the AmeriFlux forested site located at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA (40A degrees 1'58 '' N;105A degrees 32'47 '' W) were used. The model reasonably captures V(d) variations for both dry and wet conditions but has problems at nighttime. Experiments were performed to assess the sensitivity of V(d) calculations to surface characteristics related to vegetation and soil parameters. The results indicated that V(d) values are sensitive to accurate specifications of the leaf area index (LAI) and a lesser extent to vegetation type, maximum stomatal resistance (R(smax) ) and soil texture prescription. The model sensitivity to canopy resistance was noted for both daytime and nighttime. For this forest site, neither soil textures nor soil moisture appeared to affect V(d) calculations significantly, though they affected the surface heat-flux estimation particularly under low soil moisture conditions. Therefore, the V(d) estimation in the Noah model can be enhanced by either site-specific LAI or assimilating regional normal difference vegetation index information for specific time periods. Results also highlighted the need to lower the current constant R(smax) value used in Noah and other land-surface models."	0006-8314		NOV	2010	137	2				271	290		10.1007/s10546-010-9531-y

It is found that the ionosphere upper transition height is very low, with significant local time, latitude and seasonal variations, during the extremely low solar minimum of 2008. The transition height is higher in the daytime than at night, except over middle latitude region of winter hemisphere, where the transition height has minimum in the morning. There is a pronounced peak over equator for all seasons. The transition height is higher in summer than in winter hemisphere.

A 24-h precipitation cycle is observed over the entire period. The diurnal variation of precipitation over the South Korea shows that the nighttime maximum precipitation in Period_1 is affected by a largescale system; in contrast, the daytime maximum precipitation in Period_2 resulted from mesoscale convections is induced by thermal instability and moisture advection. The phases of the diurnal variation of simulated precipitation are consistent with those of the observed precipitation.

The climate simulations are performed with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model 3.5 (CLM3.5) coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model 3 (CAM3) and a slab ocean model. We use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface albedo product to represent surface albedo in the CLM3.5 for both present day and to reconstruct the surface albedo for natural pre-agriculture conditions. We compare simulations including vegetation changes and surface albedo changes to simulations including only surface albedo changes. We find that the surface albedo change is most dominant in temperate regions while the change in evapotranspiration drives the climate response in the tropics. Our results show that land cover changes contribute to an annual global warming of 0.04 K, but there are large regional differences. In North America and Europe, the surface temperatures decrease by -0.11 and -0.09 K, respectively, while in India the surface temperatures increase by 0.09 K. When we fix the vegetation cover in the simulations and let the climate changes be driven only by the differences in surface albedo, the annual global mean surface warming is reduced, and all three regions are now associated with surface cooling. We also show that the surface albedo value for cropland is of major importance in climate simulations of land cover change. The surface albedo effect is the main driving mechanism when the change in surface albedo between agricultural and natural vegetation is substantial. Finally, we argue that differences in the surface albedo value of cropland implemented in earlier land use change studies explain the diversity in the sign and magnitude of the climate response.

A derived diurnal mean CRF, solved as a function of solar zenith angle, theta, though varied over the solar day, is used to evaluate the sensitivity and influence of theta on CRF calculations. Although a total mean net (NET) CRF of 36.5 +/- 48.4 W m (2), estimated using direct observation data, is approximately equal to the value of 36.8 +/- 50.4 W m (2) from the diurnal mean simulations, monthly differences illustrate a seasonality function dictating the influence of theta on CRF. A significant positive NET effect exceeding similar to 80 W m (2) over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is found, which is in contrast to a NET CRF found to be closer to 20 W m (2) for most parts of China. This finding is attributable to a more prominent warming effect of cirrus clouds observed over higher terrain.

Multimodel assessment of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere: Tropics and global trends	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The performance of 18 coupled Chemistry Climate Models (CCMs) in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative diagnostics. Trends in tropopause quantities in the tropics and the extratropical Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) are analyzed. A quantitative grading methodology for evaluating CCMs is extended to include variability and used to develop four different grades for tropical tropopause temperature and pressure, water vapor and ozone. Four of the 18 models and the multi-model mean meet quantitative and qualitative standards for reproducing key processes in the TTL. Several diagnostics are performed on a subset of the models analyzing the Tropopause Inversion Layer (TIL), Lagrangian cold point and TTL transit time. Historical decreases in tropical tropopause pressure and decreases in water vapor are simulated, lending confidence to future projections. The models simulate continued decreases in tropopause pressure in the 21st century, along with similar to 1K increases per century in cold point tropopause temperature and 0.5-1 ppmv per century increases in water vapor above the tropical tropopause. TTL water vapor increases below the cold point. In two models, these trends are associated with 35% increases in TTL cloud fraction. These changes indicate significant perturbations to TTL processes, specifically to deep convective heating and humidity transport. Ozone in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere has significant and hemispheric asymmetric trends. O(3) is projected to increase by nearly 30% due to ozone recovery in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and due to enhancements in the stratospheric circulation. These UTLS ozone trends may have significant effects in the TTL and the troposphere."	0148-0227		OCT 23	2010	115							D00M08	10.1029/2009JD013638

Multimodel assessment of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere: Extratropics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"A multimodel assessment of the performance of chemistry-climate models (CCMs) in the extratropical upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) is conducted for the first time. Process-oriented diagnostics are used to validate dynamical and transport characteristics of 18 CCMs using meteorological analyses and aircraft and satellite observations. The main dynamical and chemical climatological characteristics of the extratropical UTLS are generally well represented by the models, despite the limited horizontal and vertical resolution. The seasonal cycle of lowermost stratospheric mass is realistic, however with a wide spread in its mean value. A tropopause inversion layer is present in most models, although the maximum in static stability is located too high above the tropopause and is somewhat too weak, as expected from limited model resolution. Similar comments apply to the extratropical tropopause transition layer. The seasonality in lower stratospheric chemical tracers is consistent with the seasonality in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Both vertical and meridional tracer gradients are of similar strength to those found in observations. Models that perform less well tend to use a semi-Lagrangian transport scheme and/or have a very low resolution. Two models, and the multimodel mean, score consistently well on all diagnostics, while seven other models score well on all diagnostics except the seasonal cycle of water vapor. Only four of the models are consistently below average. The lack of tropospheric chemistry in most models limits their evaluation in the upper troposphere. Finally, the UTLS is relatively sparsely sampled by observations, limiting our ability to quantitatively evaluate many aspects of model performance."	0148-0227		OCT 23	2010	115							D00M09	10.1029/2010JD013884

Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle(2) and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network(3), meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm(4). In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface-models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 +/- 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Nino event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science."	0028-0836		OCT 21	2010	467	7318				951	954		10.1038/nature09396

Momentum budget of the migrating diurnal tide in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The leading terms of the momentum budget of the migrating diurnal tide are diagnosed from temperatures and geopotential height provided by Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) and the horizontal wind vector provided by TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI). The ""wave drag"" upon the tide is inferred as a residual of the classical and linear advective terms in the zonal and meridional momentum equations. Between 85 and 100 km, the migrating diurnal tide is generally far from the classical description of Chapman and Lindzen (1970). The leading nonclassical terms are the meridional advection of zonally averaged momentum and wave drag effects encapsulated in the momentum residuals. The magnitudes of the momentum residuals range between 50 and 150 m s(-1) d(-1) for the zonal component and 100-250 m s(-1) d(-1) for the meridional component. The zonal momentum residual is generally in quadrature with the zonal wind tide, while the meridional momentum residual is in antiphase with the meridional wind above 95 km. Winds and temperatures exhibit maximum amplitudes during the vernal equinox season, but only a minor reduction in wave damping is observed. Our results suggest that Rayleigh damping is inadequate to describe the relationship between the tide and the forces acting upon it."	0148-0227		OCT 21	2010	115							D20105	10.1029/2009JD013684

Quasi-periodic propagating signals in the solar corona: The signature of magnetoacoustic waves or high-velocity upflows?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"Since the discovery of quasi-periodic propagating oscillations with periods of order 3-10 minutes in coronal loops with TRACE and SOHO/EIT (and later with STEREO/EUVI and Hinode/EIS), they have been almost universally interpreted as evidence for propagating slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves in the low plasma beta coronal environment. Here we show that this interpretation is not unique, and that for coronal loops associated with plage regions (as opposed to sunspots), the presence of magnetoacoustic waves may not be the only cause for the observed quasi-periodicities. We focus instead on the ubiquitous, faint upflows at 50-150 km s(-1) that were recently discovered as blueward asymmetries of spectral line profiles in footpoint regions of coronal loops, and as faint disturbances propagating along coronal loops in EUV/X-ray imaging time series. These faint upflows are most likely driven from below and have been associated with chromospheric jets that are (partially) rapidly heated to coronal temperatures at low heights. These two scenarios (waves versus flows) are difficult to differentiate using only imaging data, but careful analysis of spectral line profiles indicates that faint upflows are likely responsible for some of the observed quasi-periodic oscillatory signals in the corona. We show that recent EIS measurements of intensity and velocity oscillations of coronal lines (which had previously been interpreted as direct evidence for propagating waves) are actually accompanied by significant oscillations in the line width that are driven by a quasi-periodically varying component of emission in the blue wing of the line. This faint additional component of blue-shifted emission quasi-periodically modulates the peak intensity and line centroid of a single Gaussian fit to the spectral profile with the same small amplitudes (respectively a few percent of background intensity and a few km s(-1)) that were previously used to infer the presence of slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves. Our results indicate that it is possible that a significant fraction of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers and spectrographs that have previously been interpreted as propagating magnetoacoustic waves are instead caused by these upflows. The different physical cause for coronal oscillations would significantly impact the prospects of successful coronal seismology using propagating disturbances in coronal loops."	0004-637X		OCT 20	2010	722	2				1013	1029		10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1013

Reconnected field topology produced by current-sheet dissipation	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"In this paper, the third in a series of papers on topological changes of magnetic fields, we study how the dissipation of an initial current sheet (CS) in a closed three-dimensional (3D) field affects the field topology. The initial field is everywhere potential except at the location of the CS which is in macroscopic equilibrium under the condition of perfect conductivity. In the physical world of extremely high, but finite, conductivity, the CS dissipates and the field seeks a new equilibrium state in the form of an everywhere potential field since the initial field is everywhere untwisted. Our semi-analytical study indicates that the dissipation of the single initial CS must induce formation of additional CSs in extensive parts of the magnetic volume. The subsequent dissipation of these other sheets brings about topological changes by magnetic reconnection in order for the global field to become potential. In 2D fields, the magnetic reconnection due to the dissipation of a CS is limited to the magnetic vicinity of the dissipating sheet. Thus, the consequence of CS dissipation is physically and topologically quite different in 2D and 3D fields. A discussion of this result is given in general relation to the Parker theory of spontaneous CSs and heating in the solar corona and solar flares."	0004-637X		OCT 20	2010	722	2				1844	1853		10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1844

On the ionospheric application of Poynting's theorem	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"It has been proposed that the geomagnetic field-aligned component of the perturbation Poynting vector above the ionosphere, as obtained from the cross product of the electric and magnetic perturbation fields observed on a spacecraft, may be used to estimate the field line-integrated electromagnetic energy dissipation in the ionosphere below. This paper clarifies conditions under which this approximation may be either valid or invalid. It is shown that the downward field-aligned component of the perturbation Poynting vector can underestimate the electromagnetic energy dissipation in regions of high ionospheric Pedersen conductance, and it can significantly overestimate the dissipation in regions of low conductance. Local values of upward perturbation Poynting vector do not necessarily correspond to net ionospheric generation of electromagnetic energy along that geomagnetic field line. An Equipotential Boundary Poynting Flux (EBPF) theorem is presented for quasi-static electromagnetic fields as follows: when a volume of the ionosphere is bounded on the sides by an equipotential surface and on the bottom by the base of the conducting ionosphere, then the area integral of the downward normal component of the perturbation Poynting vector over the top of that volume equals the energy dissipation within the volume. This equality does not apply to volumes with arbitrary side boundaries. However, the EBPF theorem can be applied separately to different components of the electric potential, such as the large- and small-scale components. Since contours of the small-scale component of potential tend to close over relatively localized regions, the associated small-scale structures of downward perturbation Poynting vector tend to be dissipated locally."	0148-0227		OCT 14	2010	115							A10311	10.1029/2010JA015768

Impact of stratospheric ozone on Southern Hemisphere circulation change: A multimodel assessment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The impact of stratospheric ozone on the tropospheric general circulation of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is examined with a set of chemistry-climate models participating in the Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC)/Chemistry-Climate Model Validation project phase 2 (CCMVal-2). Model integrations of both the past and future climates reveal the crucial role of stratospheric ozone in driving SH circulation change: stronger ozone depletion in late spring generally leads to greater poleward displacement and intensification of the tropospheric midlatitude jet, and greater expansion of the SH Hadley cell in the summer. These circulation changes are systematic as poleward displacement of the jet is typically accompanied by intensification of the jet and expansion of the Hadley cell. Overall results are compared with coupled models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), and possible mechanisms are discussed. While the tropospheric circulation response appears quasi-linearly related to stratospheric ozone changes, the quantitative response to a given forcing varies considerably from one model to another. This scatter partly results from differences in model climatology. It is shown that poleward intensification of the westerly jet is generally stronger in models whose climatological jet is biased toward lower latitudes. This result is discussed in the context of quasi-geostrophic zonal mean dynamics."	0148-0227		OCT 13	2010	115							D00M07	10.1029/2010JD014271

Using an energy-economic growth model that accounts for a range of demographic dynamics, we show that slowing population growth could provide 16-29% of the emissions reductions suggested to be necessary by 2050 to avoid dangerous climate change.

From 4 years of the Colorado State University sodium wind-temperature lidar data set (2002-2005; total of similar to 1600 nocturnal h), we observed an altitude distribution of high wind velocity and wind shears between 80 and 105 km, similar to the results of chemical release experiments. Our lidar data show conclusively that when the observed wind shears are plotted as a function of the squared Brunt-Vaisala frequency, N(2), they are below the value corresponding to the Richardson number of 1/4, which is a necessary condition of the onset of dynamic instability. This suggests that large wind shears can be sustained in the region of high static stability, for example, in the lower thermosphere, where large wind shears are often observed by rocket sounding. The full-diurnal-cycle lidar data enable the extraction of tidal wave components with periods of 24, 12, 8, and 6 h, therefore allowing us to reveal the strong correlation of 60% between large wind shears (>50 m s(-1) km(-1)) and tidal waves.

Fidelity and efficiency of time stepping schemes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH									"A major neglected weakness of many current hydrological models is the numerical method used to solve the governing model equations. This paper thoroughly evaluates several classes of time stepping schemes in terms of numerical reliability and computational efficiency in the context of conceptual hydrological modeling. Numerical experiments are carried out using 8 distinct time stepping algorithms and 6 different conceptual rainfall-runoff models, applied in a densely gauged experimental catchment, as well as in 12 basins with diverse physical and hydroclimatic characteristics. Results show that, over vast regions of the parameter space, the numerical errors of fixed-step explicit schemes commonly used in hydrology routinely dwarf the structural errors of the model conceptualization. This substantially degrades model predictions, but also, disturbingly, generates fortuitously adequate performance for parameter sets where numerical errors compensate for model structural errors. Simply running fixed-step explicit schemes with shorter time steps provides a poor balance between accuracy and efficiency: in some cases daily-step adaptive explicit schemes with moderate error tolerances achieved comparable or higher accuracy than 15 min fixed-step explicit approximations but were nearly 10 times more efficient. From the range of simple time stepping schemes investigated in this work, the fixed-step implicit Euler method and the adaptive explicit Heun method emerge as good practical choices for the majority of simulation scenarios. In combination with the companion paper, where impacts on model analysis, interpretation, and prediction are assessed, this two-part study vividly highlights the impact of numerical errors on critical performance aspects of conceptual hydrological models and provides practical guidelines for robust numerical implementation."	0043-1397		OCT 8	2010	46							W10510	10.1029/2009WR008894

Impact of time stepping schemes on model analysis and prediction	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH									"Despite the widespread use of conceptual hydrological models in environmental research and operations, they remain frequently implemented using numerically unreliable methods. This paper considers the impact of the time stepping scheme on model analysis (sensitivity analysis, parameter optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation) and prediction. It builds on the companion paper (Clark and Kavetski, 2010), which focused on numerical accuracy, fidelity, and computational efficiency. Empirical and theoretical analysis of eight distinct time stepping schemes for six different hydrological models in 13 diverse basins demonstrates several critical conclusions. (1) Unreliable time stepping schemes, in particular, fixed-step explicit methods, suffer from troublesome numerical artifacts that severely deform the objective function of the model. These deformations are not rare isolated instances but can arise in any model structure, in any catchment, and under common hydroclimatic conditions. (2) Sensitivity analysis can be severely contaminated by numerical errors, often to the extent that it becomes dominated by the sensitivity of truncation errors rather than the model equations. (3) Robust time stepping schemes generally produce ""better behaved"" objective functions, free of spurious local optima, and with sufficient numerical continuity to permit parameter optimization using efficient quasi Newton methods. When implemented within a multistart framework, modern Newton-type optimizers are robust even when started far from the optima and provide valuable diagnostic insights not directly available from evolutionary global optimizers. (4) Unreliable time stepping schemes lead to inconsistent and biased inferences of the model parameters and internal states. (5) Even when interactions between hydrological parameters and numerical errors provide ""the right result for the wrong reason"" and the calibrated model performance appears adequate, unreliable time stepping schemes make the model unnecessarily fragile in predictive mode, undermining validation assessments and operational use. Erroneous or misleading conclusions of model analysis and prediction arising from numerical artifacts in hydrological models are intolerable, especially given that robust numerics are accepted as mainstream in other areas of science and engineering. We hope that the vivid empirical findings will encourage the conceptual hydrological community to close its Pandora's box of numerical problems, paving the way for more meaningful model application and interpretation."	0043-1397		OCT 8	2010	46							W10511	10.1029/2009WR008896

Influence of cusp O(+) outflow on magnetotail dynamics in a multifluid MHD model of the magnetosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"A multifluid version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global simulation model has been used to investigate the effects of outflowing ionospheric O(+) on the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. To quantify these effects, we specify the number density, upward parallel velocity, and temperature of the O(+) outflow in a limited area of the low-altitude simulation boundary representing the projection of cusp, cleft, and low-latitude boundary layer. A baseline simulation without O(+) outflow is compared with simulations with a range of fluxes and initial velocities. In the cases with high fluxes, it is shown that the configuration of the magnetosphere is dramatically changed. In particular, the cross-polar cap potential is reduced, the polar cap area is increased, and the nightside reconnection line is moved earthward. Furthermore, in one case, the O+ outflow leads to the onset of a second substorm not seen in the other simulation runs."	0148-0227		OCT 2	2010	115							A00J05	10.1029/2010JA015579

Climate change interacts strongly with fishery systems, and adds to the inherent uncertainty in those complex, interlinked systems. The reality of these uncertainties and linkages leads to a recognition of the need for robust and adaptive management approaches in order to enhance system resilience. To this end, the paper proposes a focus on stronger moves to 'integrative science' methods and processes - to support suitable institutional responses, a broader planning perspective, and development of suitable resilience-building strategies. The paper explores how synergies between institutional change and integrative science can facilitate the development of more effective fisheries policy approaches. Specifically, integrative science can provide a vehicle (1) to examine policy options with respect to their robustness to uncertainty, particularly to climate-related regime shifts and (2) to allow better assessments of behavioral responses of fish, humans and institutions. The argument is made that understanding these aspects of fishery systems and fishery governance is valuable even in the absence of climate-induced processes of change, but that attention to climate change both reinforces the need for, and facilitates the move toward, implementation of integrative science for improved fishery governance.

Global precipitation extremes associated with diurnally varying low-level jets	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"Extreme rainfall events have important societal impacts: for example, by causing flooding, replenishing reservoirs, and affecting agricultural yields. Previous literature has documented linkages between rainfall extremes and nocturnal low-level jets (NLLJs) over the Great Plains of North America and the La Plata River basin of South America. In this study, the authors utilize a 21-yr, hourly global 40-km reanalysis based on the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) to examine whether NLLJ-rainfall linkages are common elsewhere on the earth. The reanalysis is uniquely suited for the task because of its comparatively high spatial and temporal resolution and because a companion paper demonstrated that it realistically simulates the vertical, horizontal, and diurnal structure of the winds in well-known NLLJ regions. The companion paper employed the reanalysis to identify and describe numerous NLLJs across the planet, including several previously unknown NLLJs. The authors demonstrate here that the reanalysis reasonably simulates the diurnal cycle, extremes, and spatial structure of rainfall globally compared to satellite-based precipitation datasets and therefore that it is suitable for examining NLLJ-rainfall linkages. A statistical approach is then introduced to categorize nocturnal precipitation extremes as a function of the NLLJ magnitude, wind direction, and wind frequency for January and July. Statistically significant relationships between NLLJs and nocturnal precipitation extremes exist in at least 10 widely disparate regions around the world, some of which are well known and others that have been undocumented until now. The regions include the U. S. Great Plains, Tibet, northwest China, India, Southeast Asia, southeast China, Argentina, Namibia, Botswana, and Ethiopia. Recent studies have recorded widespread changes in the amplitudes of near-surface diurnal heating cycles that in turn play key roles in driving NLLJs. It will thus be important for future work to address how rainfall extremes may be impacted if trends in diurnal cycles cause the position, magnitude, and frequency of NLLJs to change."	0894-8755		OCT	2010	23	19				5065	5084		10.1175/2010JCLI3515.1

Characterization of momentum transport associated with organized moist convection and gravity waves	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES									"Tropical convection is inherently multiscalar, involving complex fields of clouds and various regimes of convective organization ranging from small disorganized cumulus up to large organized convective clusters. In addition to being a crucial component of the atmospheric water cycle and the global heat budget, tropical convection induces vertical fluxes of horizontal momentum. There are two main contributions to the momentum transport. The first resides entirely in the troposphere and is due to ascent, descent, and organized circulations associated with precipitating convective systems. The second resides in the troposphere, stratosphere, and farther aloft and is caused by vertically propagating gravity waves. Both the convective momentum transport and the gravity wave momentum flux must be parameterized in general circulation models; yet in existing parameterizations, these two processes are treated independently. This paper examines the relationship between the convective momentum transport and convectively generated gravity wave momentum flux by utilizing idealized simulations of multiscale tropical convection in different wind shear conditions. The simulations produce convective systems with a variety of regimes of convective organization and therefore different convective momentum transport properties and gravity wave spectra. A number of important connections are identified, including a consistency in the sign of the momentum transports in the lower troposphere and stratosphere that is linked to the generation of gravity waves by tilted convective structures. These results elucidate important relationships between the convective momentum transport and the gravity wave momentum flux that will be useful for interlinking their parameterization in the future."	0022-4928		OCT	2010	67	10				3208	3225		10.1175/2010JAS3418.1

Regime of walidity of soundproof atmospheric flow models	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES									"Ogura and Phillips derived the original anelastic model through systematic formal asymptotics using the flow Mach number as the expansion parameter. To arrive at a reduced model that would simultaneously represent internal gravity waves and the effects of advection on the same time scale, they had to adopt a distinguished limit requiring that the dimensionless stability of the background state be on the order of the Mach number squared. For typical flow Mach numbers of M; similar to 1/30, this amounts to total variations of potential temperature across the troposphere of less than one Kelvin (i.e., to unrealistically weak stratification). Various generalizations of the original anelastic model have been proposed to remedy this issue. Later, Durran proposed the pseudoincompressible model following the same goals, but via a somewhat different route of argumentation. The present paper provides a scale analysis showing that the regime of validity of two of these extended models covers stratification strengths on the order of (h(sc)/theta)d theta/dz, M(2/3), which corresponds to realistic variations of potential temperature theta across the pressure scale height h(sc) of Delta theta vertical bar(hsc)(0) < 30K. Specifically, it is shown that (i) for (h(sc)/theta)d theta/dz < M(mu) with 0 < mu < 2, the atmosphere features three asymptotically distinct time scales, namely, those of advection, internal gravity waves, and sound waves; (ii) within this range of stratifications, the structures and frequencies of the linearized internal wave modes of the compressible, anelastic, and pseudoincompressible models agree up to the order of M(mu); and (iii) if mu < 2/3, the accumulated phase differences of internal waves remain asymptotically small even over the long advective time scale. The argument is completed by observing that the three models agree with respect to the advective nonlinearities and that all other nonlinear terms are of higher order in M."	0022-4928		OCT	2010	67	10				3226	3237		10.1175/2010JAS3490.1

Fixed flight tracks were flown downstream of ground-based silver iodide (AgI) generators in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming. Composite data from seven flights, each with a no-seeding period followed by a seeding period, indicate that radar reflectivity was higher near the ground during the seeding periods. Several physical considerations argue in favor of the hypothesis that the increase in near-surface reflectivity is attributed to AgI seeding. While the increase in near-surface reflectivity and thus snowfall rate are statistically significant, caution is warranted in view of the large natural variability of weather conditions and the small size of the dataset."	0022-4928		OCT	2010	67	10				3286	3302		10.1175/2010JAS3496.1

This study uses data from six field campaigns to evaluate this mass-dimensional relationship in a variety of ice cloud types and temperatures and to account for the deviations observed with temperature and size, based on properties of the ice particle ensembles. Although the Brown and Francis relationship provides a good match to the observations in a mean sense, it fails to capture dependences on temperature and particle size that are a result of the complex microphysical processes operative within most ice cloud layers.

The sensitivity evaluation is performed by simulating cloud formation over two identical 2D idealized mountains using a detailed bin microphysical scheme implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) version 3. The dynamics, thermodynamics, topography, and microphysical pathways were designed to produce precipitating clouds in a linear hydrostatic mountain wave regime. The cloud over the second mountain is affected by regenerated aerosols advected from the cloud over the first mountain. Effects of aerosol solubility and regeneration were investigated with surface relative humidity of 95% and 85% for both clean and polluted background aerosol concentrations. Among the findings are the following: 1) The total number of cloud drops decreases as the aerosol solubility decreases, and the impacts of aerosol solubility on cloud drops and precipitation are more significant in polluted clouds than in clean clouds. 2) Aerosol regeneration increases cloud drops and reduces the precipitation by 2%-80% in clouds over the second mountain. Regenerated aerosol particles replenish one-third to two-thirds of the missing particles when regeneration is not considered. 3) Different size distributions of regenerated aerosol particles have negligible effect on clouds and precipitation except for polluted clouds with high aerosol solubility. 4) When the solubility of initial aerosol particles decreases with an increasing size of aerosol particles, the modified solubility of regenerated aerosol particles increases precipitation over the second mountain."	0022-4928		OCT	2010	67	10				3336	3354		10.1175/2010JAS3511.1

Here, in Part I, a radar-scattering model is developed and antenna polarization errors are investigated and estimated. In Part II, experimental data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research S-band dual-polarization Doppler radar (S-Pol) and the National Severe Storms Laboratory polarimetric Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radar, KOUN, are used to illustrate biases in differential reflectivity (Z(dr)). The biases in the SHV polarimetric variables are caused by cross coupling of the horizontally (H) and vertically (V) polarized signals. The cross coupling is caused by the following two primary sources: 1) the nonzero mean canting angle of the propagation medium and 2) antenna polarization errors. The biases are strong functions of the differential propagation phase (phi(dp)) and the phase difference between the H and V transmitted field components. The radar- scattering model developed here allows for the evaluation of biases caused by cross coupling as a function of phi(dp), with the transmission phase difference as a parameter. Also, antenna polarization errors are estimated using solar scan measurements in combination with estimates of the radar system's linear depolarization ratio (LDR) measurement limit.

"Multidisciplinary analysis of an unusual tornado: Meteorology, climatology, and the communication and interpretation of warnings"	WEATHER AND FORECASTING									"On 22 May 2008, a strong tornado-rated EF3 on the enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated between 136 and 165 mi h(-1) (61 and 74 m s(-1))-caused extensive damage along a 55-km track through northern Colorado. The worst devastation occurred in and around the town of Windsor, and in total there was one fatality, numerous injuries, and hundreds of homes significantly damaged or destroyed. Several characteristics of this tornado were unusual for the region from a climatological perspective, including its intensity, its long track, its direction of motion, and the time of day when it formed. These unusual aspects and the high impact of this tornado also raised a number of questions about the communication and interpretation of information from National Weather Service watches and warnings by decision makers and the public. First, the study examines the meteorological circumstances responsible for producing such an outlier to the regional severe weather climatology. An analysis of the synoptic and mesoscale environmental conditions that were favorable for significant tornadoes on 22 May 2008 is presented. Then, a climatology of significant tornadoes (defined as those rated F2 or higher on the Fujita scale, or EF2 or higher on the Enhanced Fujita scale) near the Front Range is shown to put the 22 May 2008 event into climatological context. This study also examines the communication and interpretation of severe weather information in an area that experiences tornadoes regularly but is relatively unaccustomed to significant tornadoes. By conducting interviews with local decision makers, the authors have compiled and chronicled the flow of information as the event unfolded. The results of these interviews demonstrate that the initial sources of warning information varied widely. Decision makers' interpretations of the warnings also varied, which led to different perceptions on the timeliness and clarity of the warning information. The decision makers' previous knowledge of the typical local characteristics of tornadoes also affected their interpretations of the tornado threat. The interview results highlight the complex series of processes by which severe weather information is communicated after a warning is issued by the National Weather Service. The results of this study support the growing recognition that societal factors are just as important to the effectiveness of weather warnings as the timeliness of and information provided in those warnings, and that these factors should be considered in future research in addition to the investments and attention given to improving detection and warning capabilities."	0882-8156		OCT	2010	25	5				1412	1429		10.1175/2010WAF2222396.1

Neighborhood-based verification of precipitation forecasts from convection-allowing NCAR WRF model simulations and the operational NAM	WEATHER AND FORECASTING									"Since 2003 the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been running various experimental convection-allowing configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for domains covering a large portion of the central United States during the warm season (April-July). In this study, the skill of 3-hourly accumulated precipitation forecasts from a large sample of these convection-allowing simulations conducted during 2004-05 and 2007-08 is compared to that from operational North American Mesoscale (NAM) model forecasts using a neighborhood-based equitable threat score (ETS). Separate analyses were conducted for simulations run before and after the implementation in 2007 of positive-definite (PD) moisture transport for the NCAR-WRF simulations. The neighborhood-based ETS (denoted < ETS >(r)) relaxes the criteria for ""hits"" (i.e., correct forecasts) by considering grid points within a specified radius r. It is shown that < ETS >(r) is more useful than the traditional ETS because < ETS >(r) can be used to diagnose differences in precipitation forecast skill between different models as a function of spatial scale, whereas the traditional ETS only considers the spatial scale of the verification grid. It was found that differences in < ETS >(r) between NCAR-WRF and NAM generally increased with increasing r, with NCAR-WRF having higher scores. Examining time series of < ETS >(r) for r - 100 and r - 0 km (which simply reduces to the ""traditional"" ETS), statistically significant differences between NCAR-WRF and NAM were found at many forecast lead times for < ETS >(100) but only a few times for < ETS >(0). Larger and more statistically significant differences occurred with the 2007-08 cases relative to the 2004-05 cases. Because of differences in model configurations and dominant large-scale weather regimes, a more controlled experiment would have been needed to diagnose the reason for the larger differences that occurred with the 2007-08 cases. Finally, a compositing technique was used to diagnose the differences in the spatial distribution of the forecasts. This technique implied westward displacement errors for NAM model forecasts in both sets of cases and in NCAR-WRF model forecasts for the 2007-08 cases. Generally, the results are encouraging because they imply that advantages in convection-allowing relative to convection-parameterizing simulations noted in recent studies are reflected in an objective neighborhood-based metric."	0882-8156		OCT	2010	25	5				1495	1509		10.1175/2010WAF2222404.1

Assessing advances in the assimilation of radar data and other mesoscale observations within a collaborative forecasting-research environment	WEATHER AND FORECASTING									"The impacts of assimilating radar data and other mesoscale observations in real-time, convection-allowing model forecasts were evaluated during the spring seasons of 2008 and 2009 as part of the Hazardous Weather Test Bed Spring Experiment activities. In tests of a prototype continental U. S.-scale forecast system, focusing primarily on regions with active deep convection at the initial time, assimilation of these observations had a positive impact. Daily interrogation of output by teams of modelers, forecasters, and verification experts provided additional insights into the value-added characteristics of the unique assimilation forecasts. This evaluation revealed that the positive effects of the assimilation were greatest during the first 3-6 h of each forecast, appeared to be most pronounced with larger convective systems, and may have been related to a phase lag that sometimes developed when the convective-scale information was not assimilated. These preliminary results are currently being evaluated further using advanced objective verification techniques."	0882-8156		OCT	2010	25	5				1510	1521		10.1175/2010WAF2222405.1

The first is a 21-yr global reanalysis performed with the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) using a horizontal grid spacing of 40 km. A unique characteristic of the reanalysis is the availability of hourly three-dimensional output, which permits the full diurnal cycle to be analyzed. Furthermore, the horizontal grid spacing of 40 km better resolves many physiographic features that host LLJs than other widely used global reanalyses. This makes possible a detailed examination of the systematic onset and cessation of the jets, including time-height representations of the diurnal cycle. The second tool is an index of nocturnal LLJ (NLLJ) activity based upon the vertical structure of the wind's temporal variation, where the temporal variation is defined in local time. The first available objectively constructed global maps of recurring NLLJs are created from this index, where the various NLLJs can be simultaneously viewed at or near their peak time. These maps not only highlight all of the locations where NLLJs are known to recur, but they also reveal a number of new jets. The authors examine the basic mechanisms that give rise to the NLLJs identified in four disparate locations, each having a profound influence on the regional climate. The first, the extensively studied Great Plains NLLJ, is used to confirm the veracity of the global analysis and the index of NLLJ activity. It also provides context for three of the many newly identified NLLJs: 1) Tarim Pendi in northwest China; 2) Ethiopia in eastern Africa; and 3) Namibia-Angola in southwest Africa. Jets in these four regions illustrate the variety of physiographic and thermal forcing mechanisms that can produce NLLJs."	0894-8755		OCT	2010	23	19				5041	5064		10.1175/2010JCLI3514.1

Chemistry-climate model simulations of twenty-first century stratospheric climate and circulation changes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"The response of stratospheric climate and circulation to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone recovery in the twenty-first century is analyzed in simulations of 11 chemistry-climate models using near-identical forcings and experimental setup. In addition to an overall global cooling of the stratosphere in the simulations (0.59 +/- 6 0.07 K decade(-1) at 10 hPa), ozone recovery causes a warming of the Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere in summer with enhanced cooling above. The rate of warming correlates with the rate of ozone recovery projected by the models and, on average, changes from 0.8 to 0.48 K decade(-1) at 100 hPa as the rate of recovery declines from the first to the second half of the century. In the winter northern polar lower stratosphere the increased radiative cooling from the growing abundance of GHGs is, in most models, balanced by adiabatic warming from stronger polar downwelling. In the Antarctic lower stratosphere the models simulate an increase in low temperature extremes required for polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation, but the positive trend is decreasing over the twenty-first century in all models. In the Arctic, none of the models simulates a statistically significant increase in Arctic PSCs throughout the twenty-first century. The subtropical jets accelerate in response to climate change and the ozone recovery produces a westward acceleration of the lower-stratospheric wind over the Antarctic during summer, though this response is sensitive to the rate of recovery projected by the models. There is a strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation throughout the depth of the stratosphere, which reduces the mean age of air nearly everywhere at a rate of about 0.05 yr decade(-1) in those models with this diagnostic. On average, the annual mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere (similar to 70 hPa) increases by almost 2% decade(-1), with 59% of this trend forced by the parameterized orographic gravity wave drag in the models. This is a consequence of the eastward acceleration of the subtropical jets, which increases the upward flux of (parameterized) momentum reaching the lower stratosphere in these latitudes."	0894-8755		OCT	2010	23	20				5349	5374		10.1175/2010JCLI3404.1

ENSO model validation using wavelet probability analysis	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"A new method to quantify changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability is presented, using the overlap between probability distributions of the wavelet spectrum as measured by the wavelet probability index (WPI). Examples are provided using long integrations of three coupled climate models. When subsets of Nino-3.4 time series are compared, the width of the confidence interval on WPI has an exponential dependence on the length of the subset used, with a statistically identical slope for all three models. This exponential relationship describes the rate at which the system converges toward equilibrium and may be used to determine the necessary simulation length for robust statistics. For the three models tested, a minimum of 250 model years is required to obtain 90% convergence for Nino-3.4, longer than typical Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) simulations. Applying the same decay relationship to observational data indicates that measuring ENSO variability with 90% confidence requires approximately 240 years of observations, which is substantially longer than the modern SST record. Applying hypothesis testing techniques to the WPI distributions from model subsets and from comparisons of model subsets to the historical Nino-3.4 index then allows statistically robust comparisons of relative model agreement with appropriate confidence levels given the length of the data record and model simulation."	0894-8755		OCT	2010	23	20				5540	5547		10.1175/2010JCLI3609.1

Composite structure of tropopause polar cyclones	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Tropopause polar vortices are coherent circulation features based on the tropopause in polar regions. They are a common feature of the Arctic, with typical radii less than 1500 km and lifetimes that may exceed 1 month. The Arctic is a particularly favorable region for these features due to isolation from the horizontal wind shear associated with the midlatitude jet stream, which may destroy the vortical circulation. Intensification of cyclonic tropopause polar vortices is examined here using an Ertel potential vorticity framework to test the hypothesis that there is an average tendency for diabatic effects to intensify the vortices due to enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling within the vortices. Data for the analysis are derived from numerical simulations of a large sample of observed cyclonic vortices over the Canadian Arctic. Results show that there is on average a net tendency to create potential vorticity in the vortex, and hence intensify cyclones, and that the tendency is radiatively driven. While the effects of latent heating are considerable, they are smaller in magnitude, and all other diabatic processes have a negligible effect on vortex intensity."	0027-0644		OCT	2010	138	10				3840	3857		10.1175/2010MWR3371.1

Retrospective forecasts of the hurricane season using a global atmospheric model assuming persistence of SST anomalies	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Retrospective predictions of seasonal hurricane activity in the Atlantic and east Pacific are generated using an atmospheric model with 50-km horizontal resolution by simply persisting sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from June through the hurricane season. Using an ensemble of 5 realizations for each year between 1982 and 2008, the correlations of the model mean predictions with observations of basin-wide hurricane frequency are 0.69 in the North Atlantic and 0.58 in the east Pacific. In the North Atlantic, a significant part of the degradation in skill as compared to a model forced with observed SSTs during the hurricane season (correlation of 0.78) can be explained by the change from June through the hurricane season in one parameter, the difference between the SST in the main development region and the tropical mean SST. In fact, simple linear regression models with this one predictor perform nearly as well as the full dynamical model for basin-wide hurricane frequency in both the east Pacific and the North Atlantic. The implication is that the quality of seasonal forecasts based on a coupled atmosphere-ocean model will depend in large part on the model's ability to predict the evolution of this difference between main development region SST and tropical mean SST."	0027-0644		OCT	2010	138	10				3858	3868		10.1175/2010MWR3366.1

The subgrid-scale quantities are modelled using a prognostic turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) scheme, with a grid that has a constant horizontal resolution of 50 m and is stretched along the vertical direction. To account for the grid anisotropy, a modified subgrid length scale is used. To allow for the response of the surface fluxes to the valley-flow circulation, the soil surface temperature is imposed and the surface heat and momentum fluxes are computed based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The model is designed with a symmetrical geometry using periodic boundary conditions in both the x and y directions. Two cases are simulated to study the influence of along-valley geostrophic wind forcing with different intensities. The presence of the orography introduces numerous complexities both in the mean properties of the flow and in the turbulent features, even for the idealized symmetric geometry. Classical definitions for the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) are revisited and redefined to capture the complex structure of the boundary layer.

Impact of Doppler weather radar data on numerical forecast of Indian monsoon depressions	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY									"This work is a first assessment of utilizing Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) radial velocity and reflectivity in a mesoscale model for prediction of Bay of Bengal monsoon depressions (MDs). The Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) modelling system - Advanced Research version (ARW) is customized and evaluated for the Indian monsoon region by generating domain-specific Background Error (BE) statistics and experiments involving two assimilation strategies (cold start and cycling). The monthly averaged 24 h forecast errors for wind, temperature and moisture profiles were analysed. From the statistical skill scores, it is concluded that the cycling mode assimilation enhanced the performance of the WRF three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system over the Indian region using conventional and non-conventional observations. DWR data from a coastal site were assimilated for simulation of two different summer MDs over India using the WRF-3DVAR analysis system. Three numerical experiments (control without any Global Telecommunication System (GTS) data, with GTS, and GTS as well as DWR) were performed for simulating these extreme weather events to study the impact of DWR data. The results show that even though MDs are large synoptic systems, assimilation of DWR data has a positive impact on the prediction of the location, propagation and development of rain bands associated with the MDs. All aspects of the MD simulations such as mean-sea-level pressure, winds, vertical structure and the track are significantly improved due to the DWR assimilation. Study results provide a positive proof of concept that the assimilation of the Indian DWR data within WRF can help improve the simulation of intense convective systems influencing the large-scale monsoonal flow.

Mass, momentum, and energy cross this boundary via biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes often involving plants. Scientific research with models and in the field strives to refine how the changing face of the land interacts with climate change. Discussed here are methods by which we simulate the vegetation and land use in global models and ways by which vegetation and land use affect climate. Model simulations suggest that global land cover changes due to land use play a greater role in affecting 20th- and 21st-century climate than changes in unmanaged vegetation. Among the biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects of land use, biogeochemical ones seem to dominate and enhance 20th- and 21st-century warming. Among the effects of natural vegetation, the positive biogeophysical snow-vegetation-albedo feedback of the high latitudes is expected to increasingly influence global climate in response to increasing vegetation density. Still, human or natural disturbances and other not well-understood processes may alter expected outcomes. Interactive nitrogen is one of the newer additions to our models. Nitrogen is found to buffer the terrestrial biosphere's response to forcings, such as changing CO(2) or climate. We still have much to learn about nitrogen's role in the Earth System. Yet, if land use dominates the effects of land cover change on climate, then human behavior will be our greatest uncertainty, which includes management choices that are not easy to predict, such as urbanization, deforestation and afforestation, crop expansion or abandonment, as well as crop rotation, irrigation, and fertilization.

Scale space multiresolution analysis of random signals	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS									"A method to capture the scale-dependent features in a random signal is proposed with the main focus on images and spatial fields defined on a regular grid. A technique based on scale space smoothing is used. However, while the usual scale space analysis approach is to suppress detail by increasing smoothing progressively, the proposed method instead considers differences of smooths at neighboring scales. A random signal can then be represented as a sum of such differences, a kind of a multiresolution analysis, each difference representing details relevant at a particular scale or resolution. Bayesian analysis is used to infer which details are credible and which are just artifacts of random variation. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using noisy digital images as well as global temperature change fields produced by numerical climate prediction models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In our three-year project, megaripple development was monitored using a digital elevation model (DEM) constructed from above-ground stereo digital photographs. Temporal dynamics of wind power (drift potential, DP) were measured, and grain-size analyses were performed on samples taken from different parts of the megaripple. The coarse grains that protect the crest enable the ripple to grow, but when ripple height becomes too high, the bed shear stress increases, thus allowing the wind to move the armoring layer. When this happens (during strong wind storms) the megaripple will flatten and even disappear, as was observed in our field study. We present measurements that for the first time directly show the megaripple to normal ripple transition, and we suggest two possible physical processes as potential causes of this phenomenon. Megaripple flattening can occur either when the wind exceeds the fluid threshold for a sufficient length of time or after a sequence of storms with winds blowing from the same direction.

Evaluation of the diurnal cycle in the atmospheric boundary layer over land as represented by a variety of single-column models: The second GABLS e+E196xperiment	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY									"We present the main results from the second model intercomparison within the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water cycle EXperiment) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). The target is to examine the diurnal cycle over land in today's numerical weather prediction and climate models for operational and research purposes. The set-up of the case is based on observations taken during the Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study-1999 (CASES-99), which was held in Kansas, USA in the early autumn with a strong diurnal cycle with no clouds present. The models are forced with a constant geostrophic wind, prescribed surface temperature and large-scale divergence. Results from 30 different model simulations and one large-eddy simulation (LES) are analyzed and compared with observations. Even though the surface temperature is prescribed, the models give variable near-surface air temperatures. This, in turn, gives rise to differences in low-level stability affecting the turbulence and the turbulent heat fluxes. The increase in modelled upward sensible heat flux during the morning transition is typically too weak and the growth of the convective boundary layer before noon is too slow. This is related to weak modelled near-surface winds during the morning hours. The agreement between the models, the LES and observations is the best during the late afternoon. From this intercomparison study, we find that modelling the diurnal cycle is still a big challenge. For the convective part of the diurnal cycle, some of the first-order schemes perform somewhat better while the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) schemes tend to be slightly better during nighttime conditions. Finer vertical resolution tends to improve results to some extent, but is certainly not the solution to all the deficiencies identified."	0006-8314		AUG	2011	140	2				177	206		10.1007/s10546-011-9611-7

Mechanisms controlling dissolved iron distribution in the North Pacific: A model study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES									"Mechanisms controlling the dissolved iron distribution in the North Pacific are investigated using the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model with a resolution of approximately 1 in latitude and longitude and 60 vertical levels. The model is able to reproduce the general distribution of iron as revealed in available field data: surface concentrations are generally below 0.2 nM; concentrations increase with depth; and values in the lower pycnocline are especially high in the northwestern Pacific and off the coast of California. Sensitivity experiments changing scavenging regimes and external iron sources indicate that lateral transport of sedimentary iron from continental margins into the open ocean causes the high concentrations in these regions. This offshore penetration only appears under a scavenging regime where iron has a relatively long residence time at high concentrations, namely, the order of years. Sedimentary iron is intensively supplied around continental margins, resulting in locally high concentrations; the residence time with respect to scavenging determines the horizontal scale of elevated iron concentrations. Budget analysis for iron reveals the processes by which sedimentary iron is transported to the open ocean. Horizontal mixing transports sedimentary iron from the boundary into alongshore currents, which then carry high iron concentrations into the open ocean in regions where the alongshore currents separate from the coast, most prominently in the northwestern Pacific and off of California."	0148-0227		JUL 22	2011	116							G03005	10.1029/2010JG001541

Representing spatial variability of snow water equivalent in hydrologic and land-surface models: A review	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH									"This paper evaluates the use of field data on the spatial variability of snow water equivalent (SWE) to guide the design of distributed snow models. An extensive reanalysis of results from previous field studies in different snow environments around the world is presented, followed by an analysis of field data on spatial variability of snow collected in the headwaters of the Jollie River basin, a rugged mountain catchment in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. In addition, area-averaged simulations of SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Spatial variability at the watershed-scale is shaped by variability in near-surface meteorological fields (e.g., elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope-scale is governed by processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve explicitly. Subgrid probability distributions are often capable of representing the aggregate-impact of unresolved processes at the hillslope-scale, though they may not adequately capture the effects of elevation gradients. While the best modeling strategy is case-specific, the analysis in this paper provides guidance on both the suitability of several common snow modeling approaches and on the choice of parameter values in subgrid probability distributions."	0043-1397		JUL 21	2011	47							W07539	10.1029/2011WR010745

High-performance high-resolution semi-Lagrangian tracer transport on a sphere	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS									"Current climate models have a limited ability to increase spatial resolution because numerical stability requires the time step to decrease. We describe a semi-Lagrangian method for tracer transport that is stable for arbitrary Courant numbers, and we test a parallel implementation discretized on the cubed sphere. The method includes a fixer that conserves mass and constrains tracers to a physical range of values. The method shows third-order convergence and maintains nonlinear tracer correlations to second order. It shows optimal accuracy at Courant numbers of 10-20, more than an order of magnitude higher than explicit methods. We present parallel performance in terms of strong scaling, weak scaling, and spatial scaling (where the time step stays constant while the resolution increases). For a 0.2 degrees test with 100 tracers, the implementation scales efficiently to 10,000 MPI tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Observations of a high-latitude stable electron auroral emission at similar to 16 MLT during a large substorm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"During an interval when the interplanetary magnetic field was large and primarily duskward and southward, a stable region of auroral emission was observed on 17 August 2001 by IMAGE at similar to 16 magnetic local time, poleward of the main aurora, for 1 h, from before the onset of a large substorm through the recovery phase. In a region where ions showed the energy dispersion expected for the cusp, strong field-aligned currents and Poynting flux were observed by Polar (at 1.8 R(E) in the Southern Hemisphere) as it transited field lines mapping to the auroral spot in the Northern Hemisphere. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the long-lasting electron auroral spot maps to the magnetopause region where reconnection was occurring. Under the assumption of conjugacy between the Northern and Southern hemispheres on these field lines, the Polar data suggest that the electrons on these field lines were accelerated by Alfven waves and/or a quasi-static electric field, primarily at altitudes below a few R(E) since the in situ Poynting flux (mapped to 100 km) is comparable to the energy flux of the emission while the mapped in situ electron energy flux is much smaller. This event provides the first example of an emission due to electrons accelerated at low altitudes at the foot point of a region of quasi-steady dayside reconnection. Cluster data in the magnetotail indicate that the Poynting flux from the reconnection region during this substorm is large enough to account for the observed nightside aurora."	0148-0227		JUL 19	2011	116							A07215	10.1029/2010JA016132

Patterns of CO(2) and radiocarbon across high northern latitudes during International Polar Year 2008	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"High-resolution in situ CO(2) measurements were conducted aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during the ARCTAS/POLARCAT field campaign, a component of the wider 2007-2008 International Polar Year activities. Data were recorded during large-scale surveys spanning the North American sub-Arctic to the North Pole from 0.04 to 12 km altitude in spring and summer of 2008. Influences on the observed CO(2) concentrations were investigated using coincident CO, black carbon, CH(3)CN, HCN, O(3), C(2)Cl(4), and Delta(14)CO(2) data, and the FLEXPART model. In spring, the CO(2) spatial distribution from 55 degrees N to 90 degrees N was largely determined by the long-range transport of air masses laden with Asian anthropogenic pollution intermingled with Eurasian fire emissions evidenced by the greater variability in the mid-to-upper troposphere. At the receptor site, the enhancement ratios of CO(2) to CO in pollution plumes ranged from 27 to 80 ppmv ppmv(-1) with the highest anthropogenic content registered in plumes sampled poleward of 80 degrees N. In summer, the CO(2) signal largely reflected emissions from lightning-ignited wildfires within the boreal forests of northern Saskatchewan juxtaposed with uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. Measurements within fresh fire plumes yielded CO(2) to CO emission ratios of 4 to 16 ppmv ppmv(-1) and a mean CO(2) emission factor of 1698 +/- 280 g kg(-1) dry matter. From the (14)C in CO(2) content of 48 whole air samples, mean spring (46.6 +/- 4.4%) and summer (51.5 +/- 5%) Delta(14)CO(2) values indicate a 5% seasonal difference. Although the northern midlatitudes were identified as the emissions source regions for the majority of the spring samples, depleted Delta(14)CO(2) values were observed in <1% of the data set. Rather, ARCTAS Delta(14)CO(2) observations (54%) revealed predominately a pattern of positive disequilibrium (1-7%) with respect to background regardless of season owing to both heterotrophic respiration and fire-induced combustion of biomass. Anomalously enriched Delta(14)CO(2) values (101-262%) measured in emissions from Lake Athabasca and Eurasian fires speak to biomass burning as an increasingly important contributor to the mass excess in Delta(14)CO(2) observations in a warming Arctic, representing an additional source of uncertainty in the quantification of fossil fuel CO(2)."	0148-0227		JUL 16	2011	116							D14301	10.1029/2011JD015643

"Crop management and phenology trends in the US Corn Belt: Impacts on yields, evapotranspiration and energy balance"	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY									"Crop yields are affected by many factors, related to breeding, management and climate. Understanding these factors, and their relative contributions to historical yield increases, is important to help ensure that these yield increases can continue in the future. Two important factors that can affect yields are planting dates and the crop's growing degree day (GDD) requirements. We analyzed 25 years of data collected by the USDA in order to document trends in planting dates, lengths of the vegetative and reproductive growth periods, and the length of time between maturity and harvest for corn and soybeans across the United States. We then drove the Agro-IBIS agroecosystem model with these observations to investigate the effects of changing planting dates and crop GDD requirements on crop yields and fluxes of water and energy. Averaged across the U.S., corn planting dates advanced about 10 days from 1981 to 2005, and soybean planting dates about 12 days. For both crops, but especially for corn, this was accompanied by a lengthening of the growth period. The period from corn planting to maturity was about 12 days longer around 2005 than it was around 1981. A large driver of this change was a 14% increase in the number of GOD needed for corn to progress through the reproductive period, probably reflecting an adoption of longer season cultivars. If these changes in cultivars had not occurred, yields around 2005 would have been 12.6 bu ac(-1) lower across the U.S. Corn Belt, erasing 26% of the yield increase from 1981 to 2005. These changes in crop phenology, together with a shortening of the time from maturity to harvest, have also modified the surface water and energy balance. Earlier planting has led to an increase in the latent heat flux and a decrease in the sensible heat flux in June, while a shorter time from maturity to harvest has meant an increase in net radiation in October.

By using the so-called pseudo salinity profiles constructed from temperature and altimetry information, here we show the improvement of salinity representation estimated by the ensemble coupled data assimilation system of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. The comparisons with climatology and independent observations show that the pseudo salinity data considerably improve the assimilation skill for the pre-Argo period (1993-2001). For the Argo period (2002-2007), there is little degradation of the assimilation skill using pseudo salinity instead of Argo observations. This result ensures the robustness of the new assimilation fields with pseudo salinity for the pre-Argo period when salinity observations are sparse. We also suggest that the interannual variability of the existing reanalysis products could suffer from erroneously-estimated discontinuities due to the non-stationary nature of the salinity observing system.

Causes of low thermospheric density during the 2007-2009 solar minimum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"Satellite drag data indicate that the thermosphere was lower in density, and therefore cooler, during the protracted solar minimum period of 2007-2009 than at any other time in the past 47 years. Measurements indicate that solar EUV irradiance was also lower than during the previous solar minimum. However, secular change due to increasing levels of CO(2) and other greenhouse gases, which cool the upper atmosphere, also plays a role in thermospheric climate, and changes in geomagnetic activity could also contribute to the lower density. Recent work used solar EUV measurements from the Solar EUV Monitor ( SEM) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, finding good agreement between the density changes from 1996 to 2008 and the changes in solar EUV. Since there is some uncertainty in the long-term calibration of SEM measurements, here we perform model calculations using the MgII core-to-wing ratio as a solar EUV proxy index. We also quantify the contributions of increased CO(2) and decreased geomagnetic activity to the changes. In these simulations, CO(2) and geomagnetic activity play small but significant roles, and the primary cause of the low temperatures and densities remains the unusually low levels of solar EUV irradiance."	0148-0227		JUL 13	2011	116							A00H07	10.1029/2011JA016508

In a companion paper, it has been demonstrated that the neutral atmosphere response to the 2009 warming can be simulated with high fidelity and can be forecast several days ahead. The 2009 warming was a major event with the polar stratospheric temperature increasing by 70 K. The neutral dynamics from the whole atmosphere model (WAM) was used to drive the response of the electrodynamics. The WAM simulation predicted a substantial increase in the amplitude of the 8-hour terdiurnal tide in the lower thermosphere dynamo region in response to the warming, at the expense of the more typical semidiurnal tides. The increase in the terdiurnal mode had a significant impact on the diurnal variation of the electrodynamics at low latitude. The changes in the winds in the dayside ionospheric E region increased the eastward electric field early in the morning, and drove a westward electric field in the afternoon. The initial large increase in upward drifts gradually moved to later local times, and decreased in magnitude. The change in the amplitude and phase of the electrodynamic response to the SSW is in good agreement with observations from the Jicamarca radar. The agreement with observations serves to validate the whole atmosphere dynamic response. Since WAM can forecast the neutral dynamics several days ahead, the simulations indicate that the electrodynamic response can also be predicted. Citation: Fuller-Rowell, T., H. Wang, R. Akmaev, F.

The impact of solar spectral irradiance variability on middle atmospheric ozone	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"This study presents the impact of solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variability on middle atmospheric ozone over the declining phase of solar cycle 23. Two different types of spectral forcing are applied to the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to simulate the ozone response between periods of quiet and high solar activity. One scenario uses the solar proxy reconstructions model from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRLSSI), and the other is based on SSI observations from the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE). The SORCE observations show 35 times more variability in ultraviolet (UV) radiation than predicted by the proxy model. The NRLSSI forcing had minimal impact on ozone, however, the higher UV variability from SORCE induced a 4% reduction in ozone concentration above 40 km at solar active conditions. The model result is supported by 8 years (2002-2010) of ozone observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument. The SABER ozone variations have greater similarity with the SORCE SSI model simulations. The model and satellite data suggests that the ozone response is due to enhanced photochemical activity associated with larger UV variability. Citation: Merkel, A. W., J. W. Harder, D. R. Marsh, A.

The signals are strongest in the upper stratosphere. When the QBO is in its easterly phase (QBOe), it appears to move gradually eastward and poleward, resulting in a predominantly positive signal over the pole, with a weaker vertically connected negative signal over the Icelandic Low. When the QBO is in its westerly phase (QBOw), the polar stratospheric signal is mainly negative and appears connected to a negative anomaly in the troposphere over the Aleutian Low. A spectral analysis of the stratospheric response in planetary waves showed a reduction of wave number 2 power under QBOe and an enhancement of wave number 3 under QBOw. These responses are characterized by an overall increase/decrease in wave activity at middle to high latitudes rather than a latitudinal shift of wave activity. There is no clear stratosphere-troposphere connection under QBOe, but under QBOw, there is a vertically coherent increase in wave power at wave numbers 1-3 with a period of 5.6-6.9 days. We suggest that the differences in response under QBOe and QBOw can be explained through differences in initial vortex strength, resulting in either a stronger influence from the low-latitude upper stratosphere (QBOe) or from the troposphere (QBOw) on the polar stratosphere."	0148-0227		JUL 2	2011	116							D13101	10.1029/2010JD015427

The goal of CM3 is to address emerging issues in climate change, including aerosol-cloud interactions, chemistry-climate interactions, and coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. The model is also designed to serve as the physical system component of earth system models and models for decadal prediction in the near-term future-for example, through improved simulations in tropical land precipitation relative to earlier-generation GFDL models. This paper describes the dynamical core, physical parameterizations, and basic simulation characteristics of the atmospheric component (AM3) of this model. Relative to GFDL AM2, AM3 includes new treatments of deep and shallow cumulus convection, cloud droplet activation by aerosols, subgrid variability of stratiform vertical velocities for droplet activation, and atmospheric chemistry driven by emissions with advective, convective, and turbulent transport. AM3 employs a cubed-sphere implementation of a finite-volume dynamical core and is coupled to LM3, a new land model with ecosystem dynamics and hydrology. Its horizontal resolution is approximately 200 km, and its vertical resolution ranges approximately from 70 m near the earth's surface to 1 to 1.5 km near the tropopause and 3 to 4 km in much of the stratosphere. Most basic circulation features in AM3 are simulated as realistically, or more so, as in AM2. In particular, dry biases have been reduced over South America. In coupled mode, the simulation of Arctic sea ice concentration has improved. AM3 aerosol optical depths, scattering properties, and surface clear-sky downward shortwave radiation are more realistic than in AM2. The simulation of marine stratocumulus decks remains problematic, as in AM2. The most intense 0.2% of precipitation rates occur less frequently in AM3 than observed. The last two decades of the twentieth century warm in CM3 by 0.32 degrees C relative to 1881-1920. The Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Goddard Institute for Space Studies analyses of observations show warming of 0.56 degrees and 0.52 degrees C, respectively, over this period. CM3 includes anthropogenic cooling by aerosol-cloud interactions, and its warming by the late twentieth century is somewhat less realistic than in CM2.1, which warmed 0.66 degrees C but did not include aerosol-cloud interactions. The improved simulation of the direct aerosol effect (apparent in surface clear-sky downward radiation) in CM3 evidently acts in concert with its simulation of cloud-aerosol interactions to limit greenhouse gas warming."	0894-8755		JUL	2011	24	13				3484	3519		10.1175/2011JCLI3955.1

Balance of the background-error variances in the ensemble assimilation system DART/CAM	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"This paper quantifies the linear mass wind field balance and its temporal variability in the global data assimilation system Data Assimilation Research Testbed/Community Atmosphere Model (DART/CAM), which is based on the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. The part of the model state that projects onto quasigeostrophic modes represents the balanced state. The unbalanced part corresponds to inertio-gravity (IG) motions. The 80-member ensemble is diagnosed by using the normal-mode function expansion. It was found that the balanced variance in the prior ensemble is on average about 90% of the total variance and about 80% of the wave variance. Balance depends on the scale and the largest zonal scales are best balanced. For zonal wavenumbers greater than k = 30 the balanced variance stays at about the 45% level. There is more variance in the westward- than in the eastward-propagating IG modes; the difference is about 2% of the total wave variance and it is associated with the covariance inflation. The applied inflation field has a major impact on the structure of the prior variance field and its reduction by the assimilation step. The shape of the inflation field mimics the global radiosonde observation network (k = 2), which is associated with the minimum variance reduction in k = 2. Temporal variability of the ensemble variance is significant and appears to be associated with changes in the energy of the flow.

Data assimilation: A fully nonlinear approach to ensemble formation using indistinguishable states	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Operational forecasting with simulation models involves the melding of observations and model dynamics to determine a set of initial conditions for each forecast. The Kalman filter (KF) provides the optimal closed-form solution to a general linear stochastic (perfect model) case, while the target of the problem has not even been defined in the case of imperfect models. Data assimilation in a nonlinear, perfect-model scenario is considered. It is shown that a new fully nonlinear approach based upon the indistinguishable states (IS) systematically outperforms the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The IS provides an ensemble of initial conditions, consistent with (i) the model dynamics, (ii) the observational noise model, and (iii) the particular observations over a window. It is argued that this is the relevant limit to consider in data assimilation, when the desire is to place high probability density in the vicinity of the target state. The advantages of the IS approach come in part from its ability to provide attractor-balanced ensembles near any attracting manifold the system may evolve on. The use of an EnKF provides a computationally cheaper alternative that place points in the general vicinity of the target. A low (i.e., 2) dimensional example is used to provide easily visualized evidence for these claims, which are then tested in a higher (i.e., 12) dimensional system. Inasmuch as the IS approach is shown to outperform the EnKF systematically in these perfect-model experiments, it provides an interesting alternative approach when informative ensembles are desired."	0027-0644		JUL	2011	139	7				2080	2097		10.1175/2010MWR3186.1

The assimilation of GPS RO soundings made use of a local refractivity observation operator as well as an advanced nonlocal excess phase observation operator that considers the effects of atmospheric horizontal gradients. The results show that the assimilation of G PS RO soundings improved the moisture analysis for this AR event. This result supports conclusions from earlier observing systems simulation experiment (OSSE) studies, but in a real event. The use of a nonlocal excess phase observation operator can produce larger and more robust analysis increments. Although this is a single case study, the results are likely representative of the potential impacts of assimilating COSMIC data in other extreme AR and precipitation events and in other regions affected by landfalling ARs, for example, western Europe, western South America, and New Zealand."	0027-0644		JUL	2011	139	7				2170	2183		10.1175/2010MWR3342.1

The tornado was rated EF2. The circulation at low levels went through two intensification periods based on azimuthal shear measurements. The first intensification was followed by the appearance of a brief funnel cloud. The second intensification was coincident with the appearance of a second funnel cloud that remained in contact with the ground until the tornado dissipated. A deep WEH rapidly formed within the hook echo after damaging wind was identified at the ground and before the appearance of a funnel cloud. The echo pattern through the hook echo on 5 June undergoes a dramatic evolution. Initially, the minimum radar reflectivities are near the surface (<15 dBZ) and the WEH does not suggest a tapered structure near the ground. Subsequently, higher reflectivities appear at low levels when the funnel cloud makes contact with the ground. During one analysis time, the increase of the echo within the WEH at low levels results in a couplet of high/low radar reflectivity in the vertical. This increase in echo at low levels is believed to be associated with lofted debris although none was visibly apparent until the last analysis time. The WEH was nominally wider than the visible funnel cloud. The dataset provides the first detailed analysis of the double-ring structure within a hook echo that has been reported in several studies. The inner high-reflectivity region is believed to be a result of lofted debris. At higher-elevation angles, a small secondary WEH formed within the first WEH when debris was lofted and centrifuged. A feature noted in past studies showing high-resolution vertical cross sections of single-Doppler velocity normal to the radar beam is an intense rotational couplet of negative and positive values in the lowest few hundred meters. This couplet was also evident in the analysis of the LaGrange tornado. The couplet was asymmetric with stronger negative velocities owing to the motion of the tornado toward the radar. The damaging wind observed by radar extended well beyond the condensation funnel in the lowest few hundred meters. However, another couplet indicating strong rotation was also noted aloft in a number of volume scans. The decrease in rotational velocities between the low-and upper-level couplets may be related to air being forced radially outward from the tornado center at a location above the intense inflow."	0027-0644		JUL	2011	139	7				2233	2258		10.1175/2010MWR3568.1

Numerical simulations are performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Model results show that the model is able to realistically capture the timing and intensity of the cyclone, identifying in this small-scale cyclone the typical characteristics of a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone. Sensitivity experiments to sea surface temperature (SST) of the simulated cyclone are discussed in the present paper. In these experiments the SST was changed by a constant few degrees uniformly throughout the Mediterranean Sea. The simulated-cyclone sensitivity to SST is studied in the framework of an air-sea interaction theory, in particular during the two phases that are fundamental for the development of an environment favorable to severe convection and thus for the cyclone to be self-sustained. The modifications of the properties of the simulated cyclones are then analyzed using an objective evaluation, based on a phase diagram used to study the tropical-extratropical transition of cyclones. The present simulations show that the features typical of a tropical cyclone are progressively lost as the SST is reduced. In the colder SST experiments, the lower intensity of the sea-surface fluxes has the effect of delaying and reducing the development of convection and the intensification of the cyclone, so that the cyclone loses the characteristics of a tropical cyclone when SST is reduced by more than 4 degrees C. On the other hand, the cyclone shows a pressure minimum deeper than the control run, with a persistent symmetric warm core, for SST increased by more than 2 degrees C. Finally, when SST is changed by less than 2 degrees C, the cyclone depth and trajectory are not significantly affected by the change in SST and, like the control run, show tropical-like features only for a limited period.

Sensitivity of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall and its interannual variation to model time step	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH									"The sensitivity of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) and its interannual variation (IAV) to model time step is investigated using NCAR-Community Atmosphere Model version 3 (CAM3). A set of multiyear numerical experiments is performed using the atmospheric model inter-comparison project (AMIP) protocol with observed sea surface temperature (SST). The default value of time step for 64 x 128 horizontal resolution with semi-Lagrangian dynamical core is 60 min. The model overestimates the mean and underestimates the standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation of ISMR systematically decrease with decrease of time step size. With respect to observations, the mean becomes more reasonable but standard deviation becomes less reasonable. There is a decrease in precipitation over the Saudi Arabia, Maritime Continent, and northwestern Arabian Sea with decrease in time step, while over the Eastern Indian Ocean, Eastern Arabian Sea, and Eastern Bay of Bengal there is an increase in precipitation. The pattern correlation of precipitation with observation systematically increases with decrease of time step. In regard to the IAV of ISMR, simulation with 20 min time step outperforms the other time steps i.e. 60, 40, 30, and 05 min. When it is decreased to 20 min, the model bias in precipitation climatology is reduced and the low-level westerly jet over the Indian peninsular becomes more realistic. There is an overall improvement in the climatology of rainfall and winds in the vicinity of Indian summer monsoon region with 20 min time step. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Although current theory suggests that soil moisture generally has a positive impact on subsequent precipitation, individual studies have shown support both for(1-4) and against(5-7) this positive feedback. Broad assessment of the coupling between soil moisture and evapotranspiration, and evapotranspiration and precipitation, has been limited by a lack of large-scale observations. Quantification of the influence of evapotranspiration on precipitation remains particularly uncertain. Here, we develop and apply physically based, objective metrics for quantifying the impacts of surface evaporative and sensible heat fluxes on the frequency and intensity of convective rainfall during summer, using North American reanalysis data. We show that high evaporation enhances the probability of afternoon rainfall east of the Mississippi and in Mexico. Indeed, variations in surface fluxes lead to changes in afternoon rainfall probability of between 10 and 25% in these regions. The intensity of rainfall, by contrast, is largely insensitive to surface fluxes. We suggest that local surface fluxes represent an important trigger for convective rainfall in the eastern United States and Mexico during the summer, leading to a positive evaporation-precipitation feedback."	1752-0894		JUL	2011	4	7				434	439		10.1038/NGEO1174

On the mode of dynamo action in a global large-eddy simulation of solar convection	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"In this paper, we examine the mode of dynamo action in the implicit large-eddy magnetohydrodynamical simulation of solar convection reported upon in Ghizaru et al. Motivated by the presence of a strong and well-defined large-scale axisymmetric magnetic component undergoing regular polarity reversals, we define the fluctuating component of the magnetic field as the difference between the total field and its zonal average. The subsequent analysis follows the physical logic and mathematical formulation of mean-field electrodynamics, whereby a turbulent electromotive force (EMF) is computed by the suitable averaging of cross-correlations between fluctuating flow and field components and expressed in terms of the mean field via a linear truncated tensorial expansion. We use singular value decomposition to perform a linear least-squares fit of the temporal variation of the EMF to that of the large-scale magnetic component, which yields the components of the full alpha-tensor. Its antisymmetric component, describing general turbulent pumping, is also extracted. The alpha-tensor so calculated reproduces a number of features already identified in local, Cartesian simulations of magnetohydrodynamical rotating convection, including an alpha(phi phi) component positive in the northern solar hemisphere, peaking at high latitudes, and reversing sign near the bottom of the convection zone; downward turbulent pumping throughout the convecting layer; and significant equatorward turbulent pumping at mid latitudes, and poleward at high latitudes in subsurface layers. We also find that the EMF contributes significantly to the regeneration of the large-scale toroidal magnetic component, which from the point of view of mean-field dynamo models would imply that the simulation operates as an alpha(2)Omega dynamo. We find little significant evidence of alpha-quenching by the large-scale magnetic field. The amplitude of the magnetic cycle appears instead to be regulated primarily by a magnetically driven reduction of the differential rotation."	0004-637X		JUL 1	2011	735	1						46	10.1088/0004-637X/735/1/46

Extension of the weak-line approximation and application to correlated-k methods	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER									"Global climate models require accurate and rapid computation of the radiative transfer through the atmosphere. Correlated-k methods are often used. One of the approximations used in correlated-k models is the weak-line approximation. We introduce an approximation T(gamma) which reduces to the weak-line limit when optical depths are small, and captures the deviation from the weak-line limit as the extinction deviates from the weak-line limit. This approximation is constructed to match the first two moments of the gamma distribution to the k-distribution of the transmission. We compare the errors of the weak-line approximation with T(gamma) in the context of a water vapor spectrum. The extension T(gamma) is more accurate and converges more rapidly than the weak-line approximation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts to address its major problems have led to new variants of the PDSI, such as the self-calibrating PDSI (sc_PDSI) and PDSI using improved formulations for potential evapotranspiration (PE), such as the Penman-Monteith equation (PE_pm) instead of the Thornthwaite equation (PE_th). Here I compare and evaluate four forms of the PDSI, namely, the PDSI with PE_th (PDSI_th) and PE_pm (PDSI_pm) and the sc_PDSI with PE_th (sc_PDSI_th) and PE_pm (sc_PDSI_pm) calculated using available climate data from 1850 to 2008. Our results confirm previous findings that the choice of the PE only has small effects on both the PDSI and sc_PDSI for the 20th century climate, and the self-calibration reduces the value range slightly and makes the sc_PDSI more comparable spatially than the original PDSI. However, the histograms of the sc_PDSI are still non-Gaussian at many locations, and all four forms of the PDSI show similar correlations with observed monthly soil moisture (r = 0.4-0.8) in North America and Eurasia, with historical yearly streamflow data (r = 0.4-0.9) over most of the world's largest river basins, and with GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite-observed water storage changes (r = 0.4-0.8) over most land areas. All the four forms of the PDSI show widespread drying over Africa, East and South Asia, and other areas from 1950 to 2008, and most of this drying is due to recent warming. The global percentage of dry areas has increased by about 1.74% (of global land area) per decade from 1950 to 2008. The use of the Penman-Monteith PE and self-calibrating PDSI only slightly reduces the drying trend seen in the original PDSI. The percentages of dry and wet areas over the global land area and six select regions are anticorrelated (r = -0.5 to -0.7), but their long-term trends during the 20th century do not cancel each other, with the trend for the dry area often predominating over that for the wet area, resulting in upward trends during the 20th century for the areas under extreme (i.e., dry or wet) conditions for the global land as a whole (similar to 1.27% per decade) and the United States, western Europe, Australia, Sahel, East Asia, and southern Africa. The recent drying trends are qualitatively consistent with other analyses and model predictions, which suggest more severe drying in the coming decades."	0148-0227		JUN 29	2011	116							D12115	10.1029/2010JD015541

Emergence of very long time fluctuations and 1/f noise in ideal flows	PHYSICAL REVIEW E									"This paper shows the connection between three previously observed but seemingly unrelated phenomena in hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent flows, involving the emergence of fluctuations occurring on very long time scales: the low-frequency 1/f noise in the power frequency spectrum, the delayed ergodicity of complex valued amplitude fluctuations in wave number space, and the spontaneous flippings or reversals of large-scale fields. Direct numerical simulations of ideal MHD and HD are employed in three space dimensions, at low resolution, for long periods of time, and with high accuracy to study several cases: different geometries, presence of rotation and/or a uniform magnetic field, and different values of the associated conserved global quantities. It is conjectured that the origin of all these long-time phenomena is rooted in the interaction of the longest wavelength fluctuations available to the system, with fluctuations at much smaller scales. The strength of this nonlocal interaction is controlled either by the existence of conserved global quantities with a back-transfer in Fourier space or by the presence of a slow manifold in the dynamics."	1539-3755		JUN 27	2011	83	6	Part 2					66318	10.1103/PhysRevE.83.066318

The average influence of decadal solar forcing on the atmosphere in the South Pacific region	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Composite mean difference analyses are applied to historical sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) data to investigate the spatial dependence of the Pacific climate system response to 11-year solar forcing. Previous work has found that the SST and SLP responses are most clearly detected near the times of sunspot maxima, which occur as much as two years prior to the centers of the broad decadal solar cycle maxima. In January-February, the SLP response at sunspot maximum is nearly the same on either side of the equator, although the amplitude is larger in the winter hemisphere. The solar influence is seen as above normal SLP in the sub-Arctic Pacific, as found previously, and as corresponding positive SLP anomalies in the sub-Antarctic Pacific, as shown here for the first time. These SLP anomalies are associated with previously documented signals at sunspot maxima of greater ocean upwelling and cooling along the Pacific equator, and a poleward extension of the tropical convergence zones in both hemispheres. Previous studies using multiple linear regression methods show the broad decadal solar maxima being associated with the lagged warm response in equatorial Pacific SSTs seen in the composites, which is not inconsistent with the present results. In the South Pacific Ocean, the solar effect is visible in the southern summer in the year before the sunspot number peak. The SST and SLP anomalies in the South Pacific in the solar peaks differ markedly from those in Cold Events (La Nina events) of the Southern Oscillation. Citation: van Loon, H., and G. A.

Ground-based observations of the tide have resolved short-term variations attributed to nonlinear interactions between the tide and planetary waves that are also in the region. Using the NCAR Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM), we simulate a quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) event under late-January conditions. In this case, sideband sum and difference child waves are resolved, indicating that a nonlinear interaction is occurring between the QTDW and the tide. The migrating diurnal tide in the MLT displays local amplitude decreases of 20-40%, as well as a shortening of vertical wavelength by roughly 4 km. Examining the physical mechanisms driving the interaction, nonlinear advection is found to result in amplification of the tide in some regions and damping in others, manifesting as increased smoothing of the tidal structure when the QTDW is present in the MLT. Additionally, the QTDW also enhances the easterly summer mean wind jet that can also account for changes in tidal amplitude and vertical wavelength. We find that QTDW-induced background atmosphere changes in TIME-GCM can drive tidal variability at levels greater than nonlinear advection, a possibility not previously considered."	0148-0227		JUN 25	2011	116							D12112	10.1029/2010JD014996

Does positioning of the North Pacific Current affect downstream ecosystem productivity?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Fluctuations in the positioning of major ocean currents can influence ecosystem dynamics, but previously the technology has been lacking to make direct observational assessments. Here, we test the hypothesis that positioning of the North Pacific Current (NPC) is related to biological attributes of the central-northern California Current Ecosystem (CCE). To test this hypothesis we use newly available data from the Argo array and compare it with a suite of well-known ecosystem indicators over 6 years, 2002 through 2007. We found increased biomass and productivity when the NPC was shifted poleward, and suggest that positioning influences advective transport of nutrients and perhaps key planktonic organisms from the sub-arctic domain thereby enhancing mid to upper trophic level species. This study is significant because climate change is predicted to cause poleward shifts in the westerlies that drive ocean currents and positioning of large marine gyre systems. Rather than reducing ecosystem productivity, poleward shifts in positioning of the NPC may be beneficial for many species of the central-northern CCE."	0094-8276		JUN 24	2011	38							L12606	10.1029/2011GL047212

The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework."	0148-0227		JUN 24	2011	116							D12109	10.1029/2010JD015139

Evaluation over global river basins	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The augmented Noah land surface model described in the first part of the two-part series was evaluated here over global river basins. Across various climate zones, global-scale tests can reveal a model's weaknesses and strengths that a local-scale testing cannot. In addition, global-scale tests are more challenging than local-and catchment-scale tests. Given constant model parameters (e. g., runoff parameters) across global river basins, global-scale tests are more stringent. We assessed model performance against various satellite and ground-based observations over global river basins through six experiments that mimic a transition from the original Noah LSM to the fully augmented version. The model shows transitional improvements in modeling runoff, soil moisture, snow, and skin temperature, despite considerable increase in computational time by the fully augmented Noah-MP version compared to the original Noah LSM. The dynamic vegetation model favorably captures seasonal and spatial variability of leaf area index and green vegetation fraction. We also conducted 36 ensemble experiments with 36 combinations of optional schemes for runoff, leaf dynamics, stomatal resistance, and the beta factor. Runoff schemes play a dominant and different role in controlling soil moisture and its relationship with evapotranspiration compared to ecological processes such as the beta factor, vegetation dynamics, and stomatal resistance. The 36-member ensemble mean of runoff performs better than any single member over the world's 50 largest river basins, suggesting a great potential of land-based ensemble simulations for climate prediction."	0148-0227		JUN 24	2011	116							D12110	10.1029/2010JD015140

Results show that the midlatitude trough extends from dusk to dawn in all four seasons and is most pronounced in the winter hemisphere. The troughs in the two hemispheres are asymmetric, where the trough in the Northern Hemisphere is more evident and stronger than that in the Southern Hemisphere during the equinoctial seasons. In general, the trough minimum position shows a high-low-high latitudinal variation with magnetic local time and occurs at lower latitudes under higher magnetic activity. On the other hand, the midlatitude trough structures become more complex in the Southern Hemisphere because of the nighttime plasma density enhancement of the Weddell Sea Anomaly. Our results demonstrate that the new data set of GPS radio occultation by F3/C is useful to probe the global 3-D electron density structures of the midlatitude trough."	0148-0227		JUN 18	2011	116							A06311	10.1029/2010JA015544

Surface and wind profiler observations are used to evaluate the performance of WRF-UCM. The model captures the observed nocturnal urban-heat-island intensity, diurnal rotation of surface winds, and the timing and vertical extent of sea breeze and its reversal in the boundary layer remarkably well. Using hourly SST slightly improves the WRF simulation of offshore wind and temperature. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate a delicate balance between the strength of sea breeze and prevailing offshore weak flow in determining the duration of the afternoon-evening stagnation in HG. When the morning offshore flow is weak (3-5 m s(-1)), variations (1 degrees-3 degrees C) in surface temperature caused by environmental conditions substantially modify the wind fields over HG. The existence of the city itself seems to favor stagnation. Extremely dry soils increase daytime surface temperature by about 2 degrees C, produced more vigorous boundary layer and faster moving sea breeze, favoring stagnation during late afternoon. The simulation with dry soils produces a 3 h shorter duration stagnation in the afternoon and 4 h longer duration in the evening, which may lead to more severe nighttime air pollution. Hourly variations of SST in shallow water in the Galveston Bay substantially affect the low-level wind speed in HG."	0148-0227		JUN 17	2011	116							D12105	10.1029/2010JD015533

Relationship of cloud top to the tropopause and jet structure from CALIPSO data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Cloud top and tropopause relationships are examined using cloud top observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) cloud data and National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS) tropopause data. Statistical analyses of cloud top occurrence in tropopause and jet referenced relative altitude coordinates are performed on a global scale using 4 years (2006-2010) of CALIPSO 5 km resolution cloud layer data. The results show that the thermal tropopause appears to be a significant constraint for the cloud top. The zonal vertical distribution of cloud tops in tropopause-relative coordinates shows a maximum at the tropopause level for both the tropics (20 degrees S-20 degrees N) and midlatitudes (40 degrees-60 degrees S, 40 degrees-60 degrees N) for all four seasons. Occurrence of cloud tops above the tropopause is examined and quantified. The results show that with the consideration of tropopause height uncertainty, the data do not provide sufficient evidence of significant presence of cloud tops above the tropopause in the midlatitudes. In the tropics, the significant occurrences of cloud top above the thermal tropopause are found in regions known for seasonal deep convection. In most cases, the occurrence is up to 24% in 2 degrees x 3 degrees latitude-longitude bins with isolated higher frequencies in the western Pacific during the northern hemispheric winter season. The vertical distributions show that these events are mostly up to 2.5 km above the lapse rate tropopause, which is comparable to the differences between the lapse rate and the cold point tropopause in regions of active convection. We speculate that this separation may be responsible for a significant fraction of the cloud tops that do occur above the lapse rate tropopause in our analyses. It is also important to note that our results are limited by the CALIPSO twice-daily sampling with local equator crossing times of 0130 and 1330. The data therefore do not provide a good representation of convection over land, which is known to have maxima in afternoon local times. The tropopause determination is a significant component of this type of studies, and errors in the tropopause height may lead to significantly different conclusions. Our analyses show that the tropopause product from the GFS model is in better agreement with radiosonde measurements. The Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version 5 tropopause product, given as the ancillary data in the CALIPSO data file, shows a much larger uncertainty, primarily because the tropopause is identified at the model grid levels."	0148-0227		JUN 16	2011	116							D12201	10.1029/2010JD015462

An increase in measured momentum flux of approximately 50% is observed over the 10 degrees N-30 degrees N latitude band during the boreal monsoon period, with around half of the annual momentum flux for this latitude range measured during this period; however, the limited correspondence in the North American region suggests that at least some of this increase may be due to other processes."	0148-0227		JUN 16	2011	116							D12103	10.1029/2011JD015725

Anomalous scaling of passive scalars in rotating flows	PHYSICAL REVIEW E									"We present results of direct numerical simulations of passive scalar advection and diffusion in turbulent rotating flows. Scaling laws and the development of anisotropy are studied in spectral space, and in real space using an axisymmetric decomposition of velocity and passive scalar structure functions. The passive scalar is more anisotropic than the velocity field, and its power spectrum follows a spectral law consistent with similar to k(1)(-3/2). This scaling is explained with phenomenological arguments that consider the effect of rotation. Intermittency is characterized using scaling exponents and probability density functions of velocity and passive scalar increments. In the presence of rotation, intermittency in the velocity field decreases more noticeably than in the passive scalar. The scaling exponents show good agreement with Kraichnan's prediction for passive scalar intermittency in two dimensions, after correcting for the observed scaling of the second-order exponent."	1539-3755		JUN 15	2011	83	6	Part 2					66309	10.1103/PhysRevE.83.066309

The new data range from early non-instrumental ship observations to measurements initiated in the twentieth century from buoys and other automated platform types. Improvements to existing data include replacing preliminary Global Telecommunication System (GTS) receipts with more reliable, delayed mode reports for post-1997 data, and in the processing and quality control (QC) of humidity observations. Over the entire period of record, spatial and temporal coverage has been enriched and data and metadata quality has been improved. Along with the observations, now updated monthly in near real time, Release 2.5 includes quality-controlled monthly summary products for 2 latitude x 2 longitude (since 1800) and 1 x 1 boxes (since 1960), together with multiple options for access to the data and products. The measured and estimated data in Release 2.5 are subject to many technical changes, multiple archive sources, and historical events throughout the more than three-century record. Some of these data characteristics are highlighted, including known unresolved errors and inhomogeneities, which may impact climate and other research applications.

Two-dimensional correlation functions for density and magnetic field fluctuations in magnetosheath turbulence measured by the Cluster spacecraft	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"Knowledge of multidimensional correlation functions is crucial for understanding the anisotropy of turbulence. The two-dimensional (2-D) spatial correlation functions (SCFs) obtained in previous studies of space plasma turbulence were restricted to large-length scales and covered a limited angular domain of the two-point separation vector with respect to the mean magnetic field. Here we aim to derive 2-D SCFs with smaller-length scale and nearly full angular distribution for the fluctuations of the number density and magnetic field in magnetosheath turbulence. We use the Cluster four-spacecraft measurements of the fluctuations with respect to a temporally and spatially varying background magnetic field to construct the 2-D SCFs. We find that the correlation function of the density fluctuations shows a pattern similar to that of the magnetic field fluctuations, both of which appear to be composed of two populations, whereby the major population extends along the coordinate parallel to mean magnetic field (S(parallel to)) and the minor one deviates toward the perpendicular coordinate (S(perpendicular to)). This pattern of 2-D SCFs implies that the energy of magnetosheath turbulence seems to cascade, in the inertial range close to the ion scale, mostly transverse to the background magnetic field and meanwhile partly along the field (i.e., k(perpendicular to) >> k(parallel to))."	0148-0227		JUN 9	2011	116							A06207	10.1029/2010JA015974

Magnetosphere sawtooth oscillations induced by ionospheric o+E230utflow	SCIENCE									"The sawtooth mode of convection of Earth's magnetosphere is a 2- to 4-hour planetary-scale oscillation powered by the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere (SW-M-I) interaction. Using global simulations of geospace, we have shown that ionospheric O(+) outflows can generate sawtooth oscillations. As the outflowing ions fill the inner magnetosphere, their pressure distends the nightside magnetic field. When the outflow fluence exceeds a threshold, magnetic field tension cannot confine the accumulating fluid; an O(+)-rich plasmoid is ejected, and the field dipolarizes. Below the threshold, the magnetosphere undergoes quasi-steady convection. Repetition and the sawtooth period are controlled by the strength of the SW-M-I interaction, which regulates the outflow fluence."	0036-8075		JUN 3	2011	332	6034				1183	1186		10.1126/science.1202869

The decay of turbulence in rotating flows	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS									"We present a parametric space study of the decay of turbulence in rotating flows combining direct numerical simulations, large eddy simulations, and phenomenological theory. Several cases are considered: (1) the effect of varying the characteristic scale of the initial conditions when compared with the size of the box, to mimic ""bounded"" and ""unbounded"" flows; (2) the effect of helicity (correlation between the velocity and vorticity); (3) the effect of Rossby and Reynolds numbers; and (4) the effect of anisotropy in the initial conditions. Initial conditions include the Taylor-Green vortex, the Arn'old-Beltrami-Childress flow, and random flows with large-scale energy spectrum proportional to k(4). The decay laws obtained in the simulations for the energy, helicity, and enstrophy in each case can be explained with phenomenological arguments that consider separate decays for two-dimensional and three-dimensional modes and that take into account the role of helicity and rotation in slowing down the energy decay. The time evolution of the energy spectrum and development of anisotropies in the simulations are also discussed. Finally, the effect of rotation and helicity in the skewness and kurtosis of the flow is considered. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The enhanced hydrological cycle is also expected to increase snowfall amounts due to increased moisture availability. These processes are examined in this paper in the Colorado Headwaters region through the use of a coupled high-resolution climate-runoff model. Four high-resolution simulations of annual snowfall over Colorado are conducted. The simulations are verified using Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) data. Results are then presented regarding the grid spacing needed for appropriate simulation of snowfall. Finally, climate sensitivity is explored using a pseudo-global warming approach. The results show that the proper spatial and temporal depiction of snowfall adequate for water resource and climate change purposes can be achieved with the appropriate choice of model grid spacing and parameterizations. The pseudo-global warming simulations indicate enhanced snowfall on the order of 10%-25% over the Colorado Headwaters region, with the enhancement being less in the core headwaters region due to the topographic reduction of precipitation upstream of the region (rain-shadow effect). The main climate change impacts are in the enhanced melting at the lower-elevation bound of the snowpack and the increased snowfall at higher elevations. The changes in peak snow mass are generally near zero due to these two compensating effects, and simulated wintertime total runoff is above current levels. The 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) is reduced by 25% in the warmer climate, and the date of maximum SWE occurs 2-17 days prior to current climate results, consistent with previous studies."	0894-8755		JUN	2011	24	12				3015	3048		10.1175/2010JCLI3985.1

The new method can be paired with different nonparametric smoothing methods and can also be applied to higher dimensional settings. Therefore, it provides a unified framework for computing different types of nonparametric quantile regression estimates, and it also greatly broadens the scope of the applicability of quantile regression methodology. This wide applicability and the practical performance of the proposed method are illustrated with smoothing spline and wavelet curve estimators, for both uni- and bivariate settings.

Observed increase of TTL temperature and water vapor in polluted clouds over Asia	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"Satellite observations are analyzed to examine the correlations between aerosols and the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) temperature and water vapor. This study focuses on two regions, both of which are important pathways for the mass transport from the troposphere to the stratosphere and over which Asian pollution prevails: South and East Asia during boreal summer and the Maritime Continent during boreal winter. Using the upper-tropospheric carbon monoxide measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder as a proxy of aerosols to classify ice clouds as polluted or clean, the authors find that polluted clouds have a smaller ice effective radius and a higher temperature and specific humidity near the tropopause than clean clouds. The increase in water vapor appears to be related to the increase in temperature, as a result of increased aerosols. Meteorological differences between the clouds cannot explain the differences in temperature and water vapor for the polluted and clean clouds. The authors hypothesize that aerosol semidirect radiative heating and/or changes in cirrus radiative heating, resulting from aerosol microphysical effects on clouds, may contribute to the increased TTL temperature and thus increased water vapor in the polluted clouds."	0894-8755		JUN 1	2011	24	11				2728	2736		10.1175/2010JCLI3749.1

The Ligurian Sea Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (LASIE07) and LIGURE2007 experiments took place in June 2007. The LASIE07 and LIGURE2007 data are used to validate the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS)(1) developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. This system includes an atmospheric sigma coordinate, nonhydrostatic model, coupled to a hydrostatic sigma-z-level ocean model (Navy Coastal Ocean Model), using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF). A month-long simulation, which includes data assimilation in the atmosphere and full coupling, is compared against an uncoupled run where analysis SST is used for computation of the bulk fluxes. This reveals that COAMPS has reasonable skill in predicting the wind stress and surface heat fluxes at LASIE07 mooring locations in shallow and deep water. At the LASIE07 coastal site (but not at the deep site) the validation shows that the coupled model has a much smaller bias in latent heat flux, because of improvements in the SST field relative to the uncoupled model. This in turn leads to large differences in upper-ocean temperature between the coupled model and an uncoupled ocean model run."	0027-0644		JUN	2011	139	6				1785	1808		10.1175/2010MWR3431.1

Both model-error schemes lead to significant improvements over the control ensemble system that is simply a downscaled global ensemble forecast with the same physics for each ensemble member. The improvements are evident in verification against both observations and analyses, but different in some details. Overall the stochastic kinetic-energy backscatter scheme outperforms the multiphysics scheme, except near the surface. Best results are obtained when both schemes are used simultaneously, indicating that the model error can best be captured by a combination of multiple schemes."	0027-0644		JUN	2011	139	6				1972	1995		10.1175/2010MWR3595.1

The climatological annual cycle in upwelling and its wave forcing are compared to the interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). The strength in tropical upwelling and its annual cycle can be largely explained by local resolved wave forcing. The climatological mean forcing is due to both stationary planetary-scale waves that originate in the tropics and extratropical transient synoptic-scale waves that are refracted equatorward. Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations to 2050 force a year-round positive trend in tropical upwelling, which maximizes in the lowermost stratosphere. Tropical ascent is balanced by downwelling between 20 degrees and 40 degrees. Strengthening of tropical upwelling can be explained by stronger local forcing by resolved wave flux convergence, which is driven in turn by processes initiated by increases in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Higher tropical SSTs cause a strengthening of the subtropical jets and modification of deep convection affecting latent heat release. While the former can modify wave propagation and dissipation, the latter affects tropical wave generation. The dominant mechanism leading to enhanced vertical wave propagation into the lower stratosphere is an upward shift of the easterly shear zone due to the strengthening and upward shift of the subtropical jets."	0022-4928		JUN	2011	68	6				1214	1233		10.1175/2011JAS3701.1

Turbulent airflow at young sea states with frequent wave breaking events: Large-eddy simulation	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES									"A neutrally stratified turbulent airflow over a very young sea surface at a high-wind condition was investigated using large-eddy simulations. In such a state, the dominant drag at the sea surface occurs over breaking waves, and the relationship between the dominant drag and local instantaneous surface wind is highly stochastic and anisotropic. To model such a relationship, a bottom boundary stress parameterization was proposed for the very young sea surface resolving individual breakers. This parameterization was compared to the commonly used parameterization for isotropic surfaces. Over both the young sea and isotropic surfaces, the main near-surface turbulence structure was wall-attached, large-scale, quasi-streamwise vortices. Over the young sea surface, these vortices were more intense, and the near-surface mean velocity gradient was smaller. This is because the isotropic surface weakens the swirling motions of the vortices by spanwise drag. In contrast, the young sea surface exerts little spanwise drag and develops more intense vortices, resulting in greater turbulence and mixing. The vigorous turbulence decreases the mean velocity gradient in the roughness sublayer below the logarithmic layer. Thus, the enhancement of the air-sea momentum flux (drag coefficient) due to breaking waves is caused not only by the streamwise form drag over individual breakers but also by the enhanced vortices. Furthermore, contrary to an assumption used in existing wave boundary layer models, the wave effect may extend as high as 10-20 times the breaking wave height."	0022-4928		JUN	2011	68	6				1290	1305		10.1175/2011JAS3619.1

The study compares CAM3 output with ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) 40 year reanalysis (ERA-40) data. A time mean vorticity bias equation is also formulated and the terms are grouped into categories: linear terms, nonlinear terms, transient contributions, and friction (calculated as a residual). Frontal cyclone storms have much weaker band passed kinetic energy and enstrophy in CAM3. The downstream end of the North Atlantic storm track (NAST) has large location error. While the vorticity equation terms have similar amplitude ranking in CAM3 and ERA-40 at upper levels, the ranking differs notably in the lower troposphere. The linear and friction terms dominate the vorticity bias equation. The transient terms contribute along the storm track, but the nonlinear terms are generally much smaller, with the primary exception being over the Iberian peninsula. Friction is much stronger in CAM3. As evidence, nearly all wavelengths (including the longest planetary waves) have smaller amplitude in CAM3 than in ERA-40 vorticity data. Negative near surface vorticity tendency bias on the European side of the Arctic is linked to the NAST track error (evident in the divergence term). CAM3 misses the Beaufort high in sea level pressure (SLP) due to low level warm temperature bias, too little vortex compression, and to too little horizontal advection of negative vorticity compared with ERA-40. Generally lower SLP values in CAM3 over the entire Arctic follow from lower level warm bias in CAM3."	0930-7575		JUN	2011	36	11-12				2051	2075		10.1007/s00382-011-0998-0

The direct response consists of positive SST anomalies along the Kuroshio Extension and a baroclinic (low-level trough and upper-level ridge) circulation anomaly over the North Pacific. The low-level component of this atmospheric circulation response is weaker in the case without coupling to an extratropical ocean mixed layer, especially in late winter. The inclusion of an interactive mixed layer in the tropics modifies the direct coupled atmospheric response due to a northward displacement of the Pacific Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone which drives an equivalent barotropic anomalous ridge over the North Pacific. Although the tropically driven component of the North Pacific atmospheric circulation response is comparable to the direct response in terms of sea level pressure amplitude, it is less important in terms of wind stress curl amplitude due to the mitigating effect of the relatively broad spatial scale of the tropically forced atmospheric teleconnection."	0930-7575		JUN	2011	36	11-12				2295	2312		10.1007/s00382-010-0764-8

This overview paper draws on the papers in this issue (as well as a wider array of literature) to provide an analytical review of the carbon and climate relevance of urbanization and of some of the interactions between urbanization and global environmental change. The authors' insights are used to inform a more general set of reflections on the nature of urban and environmental change, and the linkages between the two. Three over-arching themes are identified: the centrality of vulnerability and resilience as concepts shaping urban responses to climate change; the growing recognition of the role of specific governance mechanisms and systems at different scales in shaping the design and implementation of responses; and the particularities, cross-cutting issues and connections between cities from different regions (e.g., Europe, East Africa) in addressing this challenge. Notwithstanding the rapidly growing volume of information on this area of research, the challenge will be to develop frameworks to understand and effectively respond to the complex interactions between urban development, the carbon cycle and the climate system, and to turn the hazards resulting from human pressures on the environment into sources of opportunities and innovations aimed at building more resilient and sustainable cities."	1877-3435		JUN	2011	3	3				113	120		10.1016/j.cosust.2011.02.002

This review explores how urban vulnerability has been framed in recent climate change and risk research and examines the contributions and limitations each of these approaches can make to research and policy. The existence of different lineages of research on urban vulnerability offers opportunities for understanding the nature and the linkages between the key dimensions and determinants involved, and hope for a synthesis and convergence, yet some daunting challenges persist. There are discrepancies in the focus, definition of key terms, methods and policy implications of each of the knowledge areas. Research on urban vulnerability is faced with a tension between the need to represent differences within and across urban areas given by the context specific nature of the dimensions and factors involved, and the desire to identify determinants and attributes of adaptive capacity and resilience across urban areas.

They are not only growing sources of greenhouse gases, but (in common with urban settlements in other regions) are also hotspots of vulnerability to floods, heat waves, and other hazards that climate change is expected to aggravate. This paper reviews the existing literature on the climate linkages and the relevance of urban development in LAC. It briefly describes research on existing mitigation and adaptation responses. It then explores why it is important to include a pro-poor perspective in adaptation actions. Although LAC cities have been the sources of many initiatives, policies and actions aimed at mitigating emissions and adapting to climate change, these have focused mostly on mitigation. It has been difficult to promote adaptation at the local level without the necessary support from higher levels of government and the international community. This has left a gap in the support and funding of locally determined, locally driven and necessary adaptation that serves and works with those most at risk.

In this study, the possible improvement of short-term typhoon predictions near Taiwan, particularly with regard to related rainfall forecasts over the mountainous island, using Doppler radial wind observations is explored. The case of Typhoon Acre (2004) was chosen for study, and a series of experiments were carried out using the Penn State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5) with its three-dimensional variational (3D-VAR) data assimilation system. The results show that once the Doppler radial velocities were assimilated into the model, the typhoon's circulation intensified within one hour. However, when Typhoon Acre approached from the east and only the western half of its core area could be observed by the radar, the assimilation caused the typhoon to deflect southward due to the incomplete and uneven data coverage. In another experiment in which Doppler radar data assimilation did not start until Typhoon Acre moved closer, such that its entire core region could be observed. A similar track deflection was avoided. Overall, the assimilation of Doppler radial velocity data reduced the intensity error (in wind speed) by about 25%. Furthermore, the improvements in location, intensity, and circulation structure of Typhoon Acre lead to better rainfall prediction over the island of Taiwan."	1017-0839		JUN	2011	22	3				325	345		10.3319/TAO.2010.10.08.01(A)

The satellite collected 117 days of high-precision photometric data on this star, showing that it presents solar-like oscillations. HD 52265 was also observed in spectroscopy with the Narval spectrograph at the same epoch. Aims. We characterise HD 52265 using both spectroscopic and seismic data. Methods. The fundamental stellar parameters of HD 52265 were derived with the semi-automatic software VWA, and the projected rotational velocity was estimated by fitting synthetic profiles to isolated lines in the observed spectrum. The parameters of the observed p modes were determined with a maximum-likelihood estimation. We performed a global fit of the oscillation spectrum, over about ten radial orders, for degrees l = 0 to 2. We also derived the properties of the granulation, and analysed a signature of the rotation induced by the photospheric magnetic activity. Results. Precise determinations of fundamental parameters have been obtained: T(eff) = 6100 +/- 60K, log g = 4.35 +/- 0.09, [M/H] = 0.19 +/- 0.05, as well as v sin i = 3.6(-1.0)(+0.3) km s(-1). We have measured a mean rotation period P(rot) = 12.3 +/- 0.15 days, and find a signature of differential rotation. The frequencies of 31 modes are reported in the range 1500-2550 mu Hz. The large separation exhibits a clear modulation around the mean value (Delta nu) over bar = 98.3 +/- 0.1 mu Hz. Mode widths vary with frequency along an S-shape with a clear local maximum around 1800 mu Hz. We deduce lifetimes ranging between 0.5 and 3 days for these modes.

"Asteroseismic inferences on red giants in open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811 using Kepler"	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS									"Four open clusters are present in the Kepler field of view and timeseries of nearly a year in length are now available. These timeseries allow us to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in the three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811. From these parameters and effective temperatures, we derive masses, radii and luminosities for the clusters as well as field red giants. Aims. We study the influence of evolution and metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. Methods. The global oscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and the effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results. We find that the mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities Delta nu vs nu(max) relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation/damping of the oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars are bracketed by those of the cluster stars. Conclusions. Both the mass and metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791."	0004-6361		JUN	2011	530							A100	10.1051/0004-6361/201016303

About the p-mode frequency shifts in HD 49933	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS									"We study the frequency dependence of the frequency shifts of the low-degree p modes measured in the F5V star HD 49933, by analyzing the second run of observations collected by the CoRoT satellite. The 137-day light curve is divided into two subseries corresponding to periods of low and high stellar activity. The activity-frequency relationship is obtained independently from the analysis of the mode frequencies extracted by both a local and a global peak-fitting analyses, and from a cross-correlation technique in the frequency range between 1450 mu Hz and 2500 mu Hz. The three methods return consistent results. We show that the frequency shifts measured in HD 49933 present a frequency dependence with a clear increase with frequency, reaching a maximal shift of about 2 mu Hz around 2100 mu Hz. Similar variations are obtained between the l = 0 and l = 1 modes. At higher frequencies, the frequency shifts show indications of a downturn followed by an upturn, consistent between the l = 0 and 1 modes. We show that the frequency variation of the p-mode frequency shifts of the solar-like oscillating star HD 49933 has a comparable shape to the one observed in the Sun, which is understood to arise from changes in the outer layers due to its magnetic activity."	0004-6361		JUN	2011	530							A127	10.1051/0004-6361/201116633

In both models, how polar fields change as a result of changes in meridional circulation depends on the details of meridional circulation profile used. Using physical reasoning and schematics as well as numerical solutions from a flux-transport dynamo model, we demonstrate that polar fields are determined mostly by the strength of a surface poloidal source provided by the decay of tilted, bipolar active regions.

Impact of sensor characteristics on source characterization for dispersion modeling	MEASUREMENT									"An accidental or intentional release of hazardous chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear material into the atmosphere obligates responsible agencies to model its transport and dispersion in order to mitigate the effects. This modeling requires input parameters that may not be known and must therefore be estimated from sensor measurements of the resulting concentration field. The genetic algorithm (GA) method used here has been successful at back-calculating not only these source characteristics but also the meteorological parameters necessary to predict the contaminants subsequent transport and dispersion. This study assesses the impact of sensor thresholds, i.e. the sensor minimum detection limit and saturation level, on the ability of the algorithm to back-calculate modeling variables. The sensitivity of the back-calculation to these sensor constraints is analyzed in the context of an identical twin approach, where the data is simulated using the same Gaussian Puff model that is used in the back-calculation algorithm in order to analyze sensitivity in a controlled environment. The solution is optimized by the GA and further tuned with the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm. For this back-calculation to be successful, it is important that the sensor capture the maximum concentrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An elephant in the planning room: Political demography and its influence on sustainable land-use planning in drylands	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS									"Two distinct, conflicting, land-use planning paradigms affect drylands: one seeking environmentally sustainable outcomes and one addressing political-demographic concerns. The environmental paradigm is relatively new and is couched in the lexicon of sustainable development, combating desertification and biodiversity conservation. These concerns proscribe planning principles that allow for human settlement in drylands while minimizing its environmental impact. The latter paradigm has a longer history, born in central governments' desire to secure sovereignty over outlying regions. These concerns result in planning goals that conflict with environmental goals. The environmental paradigm encourages compact development and efficient land-use, while the political-demographic one encourages in-migration of 'friendly' populations and the establishment of a physical presence on a maximum amount of land. Using Israel's Negev Desert and China's Xinjiang region as case studies, we suggest that successful implementation of sustainable dryland management depends on recognizing the challenge presented by political-demographic planning motivations. As such, successful implementation of environmental planning requires resolution of existing political conflicts.

The main advantages are its flexibility for representing departures from stationarity and importantly the scalability of algorithms to large numbers of spatial locations. The key ingredients of our approach are the availability of fast transforms for wavelet bases on regular grids and enforced sparsity in the covariance matrix among wavelet basis coefficients. In support of this approach we outline a theoretical proposition for decay properties of the multi-resolution covariance for mixtures of Matern covariances. A covariance estimator, built upon a regularized method of moment, is straightforward to compute for complete data on regular grids. For irregular spatial data the estimator is implemented by using a conditional simulation algorithm drawn from a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization approach, to translate the problem to a regular grid in order to take advantage of efficient wavelet transforms. This method is illustrated with a Monte Carlo experiment and applied to surface ozone data from an environmental monitoring network. The computational efficiency makes it possible to provide bootstrap measures of uncertainty and these provide objective evidence of the nonstationarity of the surface ozone field.

In this paper, a total of 71 intense (Dst <= -100 nT) geomagnetic storm events in 1996-2006, of which 51 are driven by ICMEs and 20 by sheath regions, are examined to demonstrate similarities and differences in the energy transfer. Using superposed epoch analysis, the evolution of solar wind energy input and dissipation is investigated. The solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions and geomagnetic indices show a more gradual increase and recovery during the ICME-driven storms than they do during the sheath-driven storms. However, the sheath-driven storms have larger peak values. In general, solar wind energy input (the epsilon parameter) and dissipation show similar trends as the coupling functions. The trends of ion precipitation and the ratio of ion precipitation to the total (ion and electron) are quite different for both classes of events. There are more precipitating ions during the peak of sheath-driven storms. However, a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of the different energy dissipation branches shows that the means of input energy and auroral precipitation are significantly different for both classes of events, whereas Joule heating, ring current, and total output energy display no distinguishable differences. The means of electron precipitation are significantly different for both classes of events. However, ion precipitation exhibits no distinguishable differences. The energy efficiency bears no distinguishable difference between these two classes of events. Ionospheric processes account for the vast majority of the energy, with the ring current only being 12%-14% of the total. Moreover, the energy partitioning for both classes of events is similar."	0148-0227		MAY 28	2011	116							A05106	10.1029/2011JA016490

"Lacaziosis and Lacaziosis-like prevalence among wild, common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus from the west coast of Florida, USA"	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS									"Lacaziosis (lobomycosis; Lacazia loboi) is a fungal skin disease that naturally occurs only in humans and dolphins. The first reported case of lacaziosis in a bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus occurred in 1970 in Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA, and subsequent photo-ID monitoring of the Sarasota Bay dolphin population has revealed persistence of the disease. The objectives of this study were to estimate lacaziosis prevalence (P) in 2 bottlenose dolphin populations on the west coast of Florida (Sarasota Bay and Charlotte Harbor) and compare disease occurrence to other published estimates of lacaziosis in dolphin populations across the globe. Historic photographic records of dolphins captured and released for health assessment purposes (Sarasota Bay) and photo-ID studies (Charlotte Harbor) were screened for evidence of lesions consistent with lacaziosis. Health assessment data revealed a prevalence of lacaziosis in the Sarasota Bay bottlenose dolphin population between 2 and 3%, and analyses of photo-ID data provided a lacaziosis-like prevalence estimate of 2% for Charlotte Harbor dolphins. With the exception of lacaziosis prevalence estimates for dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (P = 0.068; P = 0.12), no statistically significant differences were seen among Sarasota Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and other published estimates. Although lacaziosis is a rare disease among these dolphin populations, studies that assess disease burden among different populations can assist with the surveillance of this zoonotic pathogen."	0177-5103		MAY 24	2011	95	1				49	56		10.3354/dao02345

On the formation of a fast thermospheric zonal wind at the magnetic dip equator	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Simulations with the NCAR Thermosphere - Ionosphere - Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) have been carried out to understand the cause of strong thermospheric zonal wind at the magnetic dip equator. The simulations show that the zonal winds blow strongly at the magnetic dip equator instead of at the geographic equator due to the latitude structure of ion drag. The fast winds at the dip equator are seen throughout the altitude between 280 km and 600 km, and the wind above 400 km is mainly accelerated via viscosity. A test simulation without viscosity verifies that the extension of the fast equatorial wind to heights above 400 km is maintained by viscous coupling with the winds at lower altitudes, in spite of there being an ion-drag maximum instead of relative minimum at the dip equator at high altitudes. Basically, viscosity is not so large compared to the pressure gradient and ion drag, but dynamics causes the pressure gradient and ion drag approximately to balance, and viscosity becomes important. The simulation results are consistent with the observations by the DE-2 and CHAMP satellites. Therefore we suggest that the zonal wind velocity in the low latitude region is controlled by ion drag and viscosity. Citation: Kondo, T., A. D. Richmond, H. Liu, J. Lei, and S.

SN is suitably modified to mitigate its negative effects while maintaining the positive effects, and the effects of the modified SN are investigated through seasonal simulations. In the sensitivity experiments to nudging intervals of SN, the tracks of simulated typhoons are improved as the SN effect increases; however, the intensities of the simulated typhoons decrease due to the suppression of the typhoon developing process by SN. To avoid such suppression, SN is applied at intermittent intervals only when the deviation between the large-scale driving forcing and the model solution is large. In seasonal simulations, intermittent SN is applied for only 7% of the total time steps; however, this results in not only maintaining the large-scale features of monsoon circulation and precipitation corresponding to observations but also improving the intensification of mesoscale features by reducing the suppression."	0148-0227		MAY 20	2011	116							D10103	10.1029/2010JD015069

We average the parallel component of the vorticity in the direction parallel to that of rotation and examine the resulting <omega(z)>(z) field for scaling properties of its zero-value contours. We find for the first time for three-dimensional fluid turbulence evidence of nodal curves being conformal invariant, belonging to a SLE class with associated Brownian diffusivity kappa = 3.6 +/- 0.1. SLE behavior is related to the self-similarity of the direct cascade of energy to small scales and to the partial bidimensionalization of the flow because of rotation. We recover the value of kappa with a heuristic argument and show that this is consistent with several nontrivial SLE predictions."	0031-9007		MAY 20	2011	106	20						204503	10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.204503

Constraining the properties of delta Scuti stars using spectroscopic eclipsing binary systems	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"Many stars exhibit stellar pulsations, favoring them for asteroseismic analyses. Interpreting the oscillations requires some knowledge of the oscillation mode geometry (spherical degree, radial, and azimuthal orders). The delta Scuti stars (1.5-2.5M(circle dot)) often show just one or few pulsation frequencies. Although this may promise a successful seismological analysis, we may not know enough about either the mode or the star to use the oscillation frequency to improve the determination of the stellar model or to probe the star's structure. For the observed frequencies to be used successfully as seismic probes of these objects, we need to concentrate on stars for which we can reduce the number of free parameters in the problem, such as binary systems or open clusters. We investigate how much our understanding of a delta Scuti star is improved when it is in a detached eclipsing binary system instead of being a single field star. We use singular value decomposition to explore the precision we expect in stellar parameters (mass, age, and chemical composition) for both cases. We examine how the parameter uncertainties propagate to the luminosity-effective temperature diagram and determine when the effort of obtaining a new measurement is justified. We show that for the single star, a correct identification of the oscillation mode is necessary to produce strong constraints on the stellar model properties, while for the binary system the observations without the pulsation mode provide the same or better constraints on the stellar parameters. In the latter case, the strong constraints provided by the binary system not only allow us to detect an incorrectly identified oscillation mode, but we can also constrain the oscillation mode geometry by comparing the distribution of possible solutions with and without including the oscillation frequency as a constraint."	0004-637X		MAY 20	2011	733	1						38	10.1088/0004-637X/733/1/38

Improving canopy processes in the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) using global flux fields empirically inferred from FLUXNET data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES									"The Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) overestimates gross primary production (GPP) compared with data-driven estimates and other process models. We use global, spatially gridded GPP and latent heat flux upscaled from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers to evaluate and improve canopy processes in CLM4. We investigate differences in GPP and latent heat flux arising from model parameterizations (termed model structural error) and from uncertainty in the photosynthetic parameter V(c max) (termed model parameter uncertainty). Model structural errors entail radiative transfer, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and canopy scaling of leaf processes. Model structural revisions reduce global GPP over the period 1982-2004 from 165 Pg C yr(-1) to 130 Pg C yr(-1), and global evapotranspiration decreases from 68,000 km(3) yr(-1) to 65,000 km(3) yr(-1), within the uncertainty of FLUXNET-based estimates. Colimitation of photosynthesis is a cause of the improvements, as are revisions to photosynthetic parameters and their temperature dependency. Improvements are seen in all regions and seasonally over the course of the year. Similar improvements occur in latent heat flux. Uncertainty in V(c max) produces effects of comparable magnitude as model structural errors, but of offsetting sign. This suggests that model structural errors can be compensated by parameter adjustment, and this may explain the lack of consensus in values for V(c max) used in terrestrial biosphere models. Our analyses show that despite inherent uncertainties global flux fields empirically inferred from FLUXNET data are a valuable tool to guide terrestrial biosphere model development and evaluation."	0148-0227		MAY 18	2011	116							G02014	10.1029/2010JG001593

On the persistence of cold-season SST anomalies associated with the annular modes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"In this study, a simple stochastic climate model is used to examine the impact of the ocean mixed layer depth, surface turbulent energy fluxes, and Ekman currents on the persistence of cold-season extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with variability in the annular modes of atmospheric circulation in both hemispheres. Observational analysis reveals that during the cold season, SST anomalies associated with the southern annular mode (SST(SAM)) persist considerably longer than those associated with the northern annular mode (SST(NAM)). Using the simple model, it is shown that the persistence of the cold-season SST(SAM) is consistent with the simple stochastic climate paradigm in which the atmospheric forcing is approximated as white noise, and the persistence of SST anomalies can be largely determined by the thermal inertia of the ocean mixed layer. In the North Atlantic, however, the simple climate model overestimates the persistence of the cold-season SST(NAM). It is thought that this overestimate occurs because the NAM-related heat flux forcing cannot be described purely as white noise but must also include a feedback from the underlying SST anomalies."	0894-8755		MAY 15	2011	24	10				2500	2515		10.1175/2010JCLI3535.1

Comparison of regime-sorted tropical cloud profiles observed by CloudSat with GEOS5 analyses and two general circulation model simulations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"CloudSat observed tropical liquid and ice water content (L/IWC, Version 4) profiles are compared with GEOS5 analyses, NCAR-CAM3, and GFDL-AM2 simulations. Both the analyses and free-running general circulation models (GCMs) underestimate IWC in the upper troposphere, with the simulated ice water paths (IWPs) being 22% (GEOS5), 9% (CAM3), and 54% (AM2) of the CloudSat retrieval. For liquid clouds, GEOS5 produces the closest match to CloudSat, with a distinct peak in LWC around 1.5-2 km. CAM3 and AM2 generate liquid clouds in a broad vertical layer in the lower and middle troposphere, resulting in slightly higher column-integrated liquid water path (LWP) than CloudSat, despite the fact that their LWC in the boundary layer is only 60%-70% of CloudSat. The data assimilation model and two GCMs produce substantial middle-level clouds, more than the CloudSat retrieval. We sort the cloud profiles by midtropospheric vertical velocity (omega 500), sea surface temperature (SST), and lower tropospheric stability (LTS). The high clouds in the models are concentrated in large-scale ascending, warm SST, and low LTS regimes, consistent with the CloudSat observation. The CAM3 and AM2 model-simulated middle-level clouds are strongly correlated with w500 but less clustered in the domains of SST and LTS. For low clouds, both CloudSat and GOES5 analyses show the preferential distribution of low clouds in regions of large-scale subsidence, relatively cold SST (SST < 27 degrees C), and high LTS (LTS > 15 K), while CAM3 and AM2 low clouds are strongly controlled by SST and LTS and only weakly correlated with w500. Exclusion of precipitating scenes would reduce the tropical mean CloudSat LWP and IWP by 73% and 48%, respectively, which does not fully explain the model-data discrepancies."	0148-0227		MAY 11	2011	116							D09104	10.1029/2010JD014971

Impact of temporal data resolution on parameter inference and model identification in conceptual hydrological modeling: Insights from an experimental catchment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH									"This study presents quantitative and qualitative insights into the time scale dependencies of hydrological parameters, predictions and their uncertainties, and examines the impact of the time resolution of the calibration data on the identifiable system complexity. Data from an experimental basin (Weierbach, Luxembourg) is used to analyze four conceptual models of varying complexity, over time scales of 30 min to 3 days, using several combinations of numerical implementations and inference equations. Large spurious time scale trends arise in the parameter estimates when unreliable time-stepping approximations are employed and/or when the heteroscedasticity of the model residual errors is ignored. Conversely, the use of robust numerics and more adequate (albeit still clearly imperfect) likelihood functions markedly stabilizes and, in many cases, reduces the time scale dependencies and improves the identifiability of increasingly complex model structures. Parameters describing slow flow remained essentially constant over the range of subhourly to daily scales considered here, while parameters describing quick flow converged toward increasingly precise and stable estimates as the data resolution approached the characteristic time scale of these faster processes. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations based on numerical error analysis and data-averaging considerations. Additional diagnostics confirmed the improved ability of the more complex models to reproduce distinct signatures in the observed data. More broadly, this study provides insights into the information content of hydrological data and, by advocating careful attention to robust numericostatistical analysis and stringent process-oriented diagnostics, furthers the utilization of dense-resolution data and experimental insights to advance hypothesis-based hydrological modeling at the catchment scale."	0043-1397		MAY 10	2011	47							W05501	10.1029/2010WR009525

What do spectral line profile asymmetries tell us about the solar atmoshphere?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"Recently, analysis of solar spectra obtained with the EUV Imaging Spectrograph (EIS) onboard the Hinode satellite has revealed the ubiquitous presence of asymmetries in transition region (TR) and coronal spectral line profiles. These asymmetries have been observed especially at the footpoints of coronal loops and have been associated with strong upflows that may play a significant role in providing the corona with hot plasma. Here, we perform a detailed study of the various processes that can lead to spectral line asymmetries, using both simple forward models and state-of-the-art three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere using the Bifrost code. We describe a novel technique to determine the presence and properties of faint secondary components in the wings of spectral line profiles. This method is based on least-squares fitting of observed so-called R(ed)B(lue) asymmetry profiles with pre-calculated RB asymmetry profiles for a wide variety of secondary component properties. We illustrate how this method could be used to perform reliable double Gaussian fits that are not over-or under-constrained. We also find that spectral line asymmetries appear in TR and coronal lines that are synthesized from our three-dimensional MHD simulations. Our models show that the spectral asymmetries are a sensitive measure of the velocity gradient with height in the TR of coronal loops. The modeled TR shows a large gradient of velocity that increases with height: this occurs as a consequence of ubiquitous, episodic heating at low heights in the model atmosphere. We show that the contribution function of spectral lines as a function of temperature is critical for sensitivity to velocity gradients and thus line asymmetries: lines that are formed over a temperature range that includes most of the TR are the most sensitive. As a result, lines from lithium-like ions (e. g., O VI) are found to be the most sensitive to line asymmetries. We compare the simulated line profiles directly with line profiles observed in the quiet Sun with SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS and find that the shape of the profiles is very similar. In addition, the simulated profiles with the strongest blueward asymmetry occur in footpoint regions of coronal loops, which is similar to what we observe with SUMER and EIS. There is however a significant discrepancy between the simulations and observations: the simulated RB asymmetries are an order of magnitude smaller than the observations. We discuss the possible reasons for this discrepancy. In summary, our analysis shows that observations of spectral line asymmetries can provide a powerful new diagnostic to help constrain coronal heating models."	0004-637X		MAY 10	2011	732	2						84	10.1088/0004-637X/732/2/84

These needs have motivated the development of pilot monitoring and prediction systems for terrestrial hydrologic and vegetative states, but to date only at the rather coarse spatial resolutions (similar to 10-100 km) over continental to global domains. Adequately addressing critical water cycle science questions and applications requires systems that are implemented globally at much higher resolutions, on the order of 1 km, resolutions referred to as hyperresolution in the context of global land surface models. This opinion paper sets forth the needs and benefits for a system that would monitor and predict the Earth's terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. We discuss six major challenges in developing a system: improved representation of surface-subsurface interactions due to fine-scale topography and vegetation; improved representation of land-atmospheric interactions and resulting spatial information on soil moisture and evapotranspiration; inclusion of water quality as part of the biogeochemical cycle; representation of human impacts from water management; utilizing massively parallel computer systems and recent computational advances in solving hyperresolution models that will have up to 10(9) unknowns; and developing the required in situ and remote sensing global data sets. We deem the development of a global hyperresolution model for monitoring the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles a ""grand challenge"" to the community, and we call upon the international hydrologic community and the hydrological science support infrastructure to endorse the effort."	0043-1397		MAY 6	2011	47							W05301	10.1029/2010WR010090

Verification of large-scale rapid transport in the lower thermosphere: Tracking the exhaust plume of STS-107 from launch to the Antarctic	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"New analysis of the Doppler shift of O(2) airglow spectra recorded by the TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) and the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) have provided conclusive evidence that the shuttle main engine exhaust plume generated in the lower thermosphere by the launch of STS-107 and imaged by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) instrument on TIMED was transported to the Antarctic in similar to 80 h, supporting a key inference from the initial study by Stevens et al. (2005). These new results were aided by improved knowledge of the effects of instrumental and satellite artifacts imposed on the Doppler spectra. STS-107 launched on 16 January 2003, and the neutral wind near its launch trajectory and nearby volume was sampled within minutes by TIDI. These initial observations suggested that the northernmost end of the shuttle's exhaust plume would move northeast and that the southern end would move southeast, motions that were identified in imagery acquired during the next orbit of TIMED. The direction and magnitude of plume motion inferred from GUVI images obtained 12, 26, and 50 h after launch were again confirmed by TIDI and HRDI. The appearance of the plume over the Antarctic similar to 80 h after launch, inferred from earlier work by the appearance of iron ablated from the shuttle's main engines, was consistent with neutral winds measured by the satellite Doppler instruments over the Antarctic. The transport of the plume from the coast of Florida to the Antarctic was aided by the favorable phase and strong amplitude of a 2 day planetary wave of wave number three in the southern hemisphere on 18 January 2003. The existence of the 2 day wave was deduced from zonally averaged and combined TIDI and HRDI neutral wind observations. We conclude that the existence of strong and sustained winds in the MLT, significantly greater than expected from empirical and theoretical models, is indisputable and provides compelling evidence supporting the global-scale nature of thermospheric winds with magnitude greater than 100 m/s observed by Larsen (2002) from 40 years of sounding rocket chemical release experiments."	0148-0227		MAY 4	2011	116							A05302	10.1029/2010JA016277

Turbulent heat fluxes during an intense cold-air outbreak over the Kuroshio Extension Region: Results from a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean model	OCEAN DYNAMICS									"The coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system that includes the Navy Coastal Ocean Model has been configured for the Kuroshio Extension region using multiple one-way nested high-resolution grids. The coupled model system was used to simulate a strong cold-air outbreak event from 31 Jan to 7 Feb 2005 in good agreement with meteorological data from a surface buoy data and QuikSCAT scatterometer winds. Latent heat fluxes and sensible heat fluxes were computed during the event with daily averages in excess of 1,500 W/m(2) and 500 W/m(2), respectively, and combined instantaneous turbulent heat fluxes up to 2,300 W/m(2). The largest heat fluxes were found in two large meanders of the Kuroshio and along its southern flank. Strong gradients in turbulent heat fluxes coincided with strong sea surface temperature gradients and were maintained during the cold-air outbreak simulation. The large turbulent heat fluxes lead to significant subtropical mode water formation during the event at a rate about 10 Sv in the cyclonic recirculation region south of the Kuroshio.

Anatomy of a closing window: Vulnerability to changing seasonality in Interior Alaska	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS									"Alaska is among the fastest warming places on Earth, and the Interior region is warming the most statewide. Significant regional-scale ecosystem services disruptions are affecting Alaska Natives' subsistence hunting and harvest success. The well-being of rural native communities is still highly dependent on access and ability to harvest wild foods such as salmon and moose (Alces alces gigas) among many others. Over the last decade communities in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon (KMY) region of Interior Alaska report an inability to satisfy their needs for harvesting moose before the hunting season closes, citing warmer falls, changing precipitation and water levels, and the regulatory framework as primary causes. Through the integration of ethnographic methods to record indigenous observations and understanding of climate (IC) with analysis of meteorological data, we provide a comprehensive picture of vulnerability to recent warming trends in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon region of Interior Alaska, one that captures more than statistical analysis of ""norms"" can provide. We will demonstrate how low exposure resulting in a small shift in seasonality has truly socially significant effects to people ""on the ground"" when community sensitivity is high because of the convergence of multiple social-ecological stressors. In this case, a seemingly small climatic exposure when combined with high social-ecological system sensitivity results in vulnerability to this climate change-related seasonality shift because of: (a) the effects on moose and the social-ecological dynamics of the system, and (b) the importance of this time of the year to meeting annual subsistence needs.

Absolute magnetic helicity and the cylindrical magnetic field	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS									"The different magnetic helicities conserved under conditions of perfect electrical conductivity are expressions of the fundamental property that every evolving fluid surface conserves its net magnetic flux. This basic hydromagnetic point unifies the well known Eulerian helicities with the Lagrangian helicity defined by the conserved fluxes frozen into a prescribed set of disjoint toroidal tubes of fluid flowing as a permanent partition of the entire fluid [B. C. Low, Astrophys. J. 649, 1064 (2006)]. This unifying theory is constructed from first principles, beginning with an analysis of the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of fluids, separating the ideas of fluid and magnetic-flux tubes and removing the complication of the magnetic vector potential's free gauge from the concept of helicity. The analysis prepares for the construction of a conserved Eulerian helicity, without that gauge complication, to describe a 3D anchored flux in an upright cylindrical domain, this helicity called absolute to distinguish it from the well known relative helicity. In a version of the Chandrasekhar-Kendall representation, the evolving field at any instant is a unique superposition of a writhed, untwisted axial flux with a circulating flux of field lines all closed and unlinked within the cylindrical domain. The absolute helicity is then a flux-weighted sum of the writhe of that axial flux and its mutual linkage with the circulating flux. The absolute helicity is also conserved if the frozen-in field and its domain are continuously deformed by changing the separation between the rigid cylinder-ends with no change of cylinder radius. This hitherto intractable cylindrical construction closes a crucial conceptual gap for the fundamentals to be complete at last. The concluding discussion shows the impact of this development on our understanding of helicity, covering (i) the helicities of wholly contained and anchored fields; (ii) the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of field evolution; (iii) twist as a topological property of solenoidal fields versus the linkage properties of open and closed discrete curves treated by Gauss, Caligarneau, Berger, and Prior; and (iv) the change of absolute helicity by resistive diffusion. These are important hydromagnetic properties of twisted magnetic fields in the million-degree hot, highly conducting corona of the Sun. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The approach combines microphysical measurements from various field campaigns with single-scattering properties for nine habits including droxtals, plates, solid/hollow columns, solid/hollow bullet rosettes, and several types of aggregates. Microphysical measurements are incorporated from a number of recent field campaigns in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. A set of 12 815 particle size distributions is used for which T(cd) <= -40 degrees C. The ice water content in the microphysical data spans six orders of magnitude. For evaluation, a library of ice-particle single-scattering properties is employed for 101 wavelengths between 0.4 and 2.24 mu m. The library includes the full phase matrix as well as properties for smooth, moderately roughened, and severely roughened particles. Habit mixtures are developed for generalized cirrus, midlatitude cirrus, and deep tropical convection. The single-scattering properties are integrated over particle size and wavelength using an assumed habit mixture to develop bulk scattering and absorption properties. In comparison with global Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data, models built with severely roughened particles compare best for all habit mixtures. The assumption of smooth particles provided the largest departure from CALIOP measurements. The use of roughened rather than smooth particles to infer optical thickness and effective diameter from satellite imagery such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will result in a decrease in optical thickness and an increase in particle size."	1558-8424		MAY	2011	50	5				1037	1056		10.1175/2010JAMC2608.1

Different studies show that such parameterizations are sensitive to the urban canopy parameters (UCPs) that define the urban morphology. At the same time, high-resolution UCP databases are becoming available for several cities. Studies are then needed to determine, for a specific application of an MM, the optimum degree of complexity of the urban canopy parameterizations and the resolution and details necessary in the UCP datasets. In this work, and in an attempt to answer the previous issues, four urban canopy schemes, with different degrees of complexity, have been used with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the planetary boundary layer over the city of Houston, Texas, for two days in August 2000. For the UCP two approaches have been considered: one based on three urban classes derived from the National Land Cover Data of the U.S. Geological Survey and one based on the highly detailed National Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT) dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). Two-meter air temperature and surface wind speed have been used in the evaluation. The statistical analysis shows a tendency to overestimate the air temperatures by the simple bulk scheme and underestimate the air temperatures by the more detailed urban canopy parameterizations. Similarly, the bulk and single-layer schemes tend to overestimate the wind speed while the multilayer schemes underestimate it. The three-dimensional analysis of the meteorological fields revealed a possible impact (to be verified against measurements) of both the urban schemes and the UCP on cloud prediction. Moreover, the impact of air conditioning systems on the air temperature and their energy consumption has been evaluated with the most developed urban scheme for the two simulated days. During the night, this anthropogenic heat was responsible for an increase in the air temperature of up to 2 degrees C in the densest urban areas, and the estimated energy consumption was of the same magnitude as energy consumption obtained with different methods when the most detailed UCP database was used. On the basis of the results for the present case study, one can conclude that if the purpose of the simulation requires only an estimate of the 2-m temperature a simple bulk scheme is sufficient but if the purpose of the simulation is an evaluation of an urban heat island mitigation strategy or the evaluation of the energy consumption due to air conditioning at city scale, it is necessary to use a complex urban canopy scheme and a detailed UCP."	1558-8424		MAY	2011	50	5				1107	1128		10.1175/2010JAMC2538.1

The study hypothesis is that urban regions alter the intensity and composition/structure of approaching thunderstorms because of land surface heterogeneity. Storm characteristics were studied over the Indianapolis region and four peripheral rural counties approximately 120 km away from the urban center. Using radar imagery, the time of event, changes in storm structure (splitting, initiation, intensification, and dissipation), synoptic setting, orientation, and motion were studied. It was found that more than 60% of storms changed structure over the Indianapolis area as compared with only 25% over the rural regions. Furthermore, daytime convection was most likely to be affected, with 71% of storms changing structure as compared with only 42% at night. Analysis of radar imagery indicated that storms split closer to the upwind urban region and merge again downwind. Thus, a larger portion of small storms (50-200 km(2)) and large storms (>1500 km(2)) were found downwind of the urban region, whereas midsized storms (200-1500 km) dominated the upwind region. A case study of a typical storm on 13 June 2005 was examined using available observations and the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), version 3.7.2. Two simulations were performed with and without the urban land use/Indianapolis region in the fourth domain (1.33-km resolution). The storm of interest could not be simulated without the urban area. Results indicate that removing the Indianapolis urban region caused distinct differences in the regional convergence and convection as well as in simulated base reflectivity, surface energy balance (through sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and virtual potential temperature changes), and boundary layer structure. Study results indicate that the urban area has a strong climatological influence on regional thunderstorms."	1558-8424		MAY	2011	50	5				1129	1144		10.1175/2010JAMC1836.1

The heavy rainfall was responsible for flash flooding and was highly localized. High-resolution Doppler radar data from 5 radar sites located over central Korea were analyzed. Numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were also performed to complement the high-resolution observations and to further investigate the thermodynamic structure and development of the convective system. The grid nudging method using the Global Final (FNL) Analyses data was applied to the coarse model domain (30 km) in order to provide a more realistic and desirable initial and boundary conditions for the nested model domains (10 km, 3.3 km). The mesoscale convective system (MCS) which caused flash flooding was initiated by the strong low level jet (LLJ) at the frontal region of high equivalent potential temperature (theta(e)) near the west coast over the Yellow Sea. The ascending of the warm and moist air was induced dynamically by the LLJ. The convective cells were triggered by small thermal perturbations and abruptly developed by the warm theta(e) inflow. Within the MCS, several convective cells responsible for the rainfall peak at Goyang simultaneously developed with neighboring cells and interacted with each other. Moist absolutely unstable layers (MAULs) were seen at the lower troposphere with the very moist environment adding the instability for the development of the MCS."	1976-7633		MAY	2011	47	3				265	279		10.1007/s13143-011-0015-x

Noah-GEM produced better V(d)(O(3)) variations due to its more realistically simulated stomata! resistance (R(s)) than WDDM. V(d)(O(3)) is very sensitive to the minimum canopy stomatal resistance (R(i)) which is specified for each seasonal category assigned in WDDM. Treating Sep-Oct as autumn in WDDM for this deciduous forest site caused a large underprediction of Vd(O(3)) due to the leafless assumption in 'autumn' seasonal category for which an infinite R(i) was assigned. Reducing R(i) to a value of 70 s m(-1), the same as the default value for the summer season category, the modeled and measured V(d)(O(3)) agreed reasonably well. HNO(3) was found to dominate the NO(y) flux during the measurement period: thus the modeled V(d)(NO(y)) was mainly controlled by the aerodynamic and quasi-laminar sublayer resistances (R(a) and R(b)), both being sensitive to the surface roughness length (z(0)). Using an appropriate value for z(0) (10% of canopy height), WDDM and Noah-GEM agreed well with the observed daytime V(d)(NO(y)). The differences in V(d)(HNO(3)) between WDDM and Noah-GEM were small due to the small differences in the calculated R(a) and R(b) between the two models: however, the differences in R(c) of NO(2) and PAN between the two models reached a factor of 1.1-1.5, which in turn caused a factor of 1.1-1.3 differences for V(d). Combining the measured concentrations and modeled V(d), NO(x), PAN and HNO(3) accounted for 19%, 4%, and 70% of the measured NO(y) fluxes, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Models of non-Boussinesq lock-exchange flow	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS									"Nearly all analytical models of lock-exchange flow are based on the shallow-water approximation. Since the latter approximation fails at the leading edges of the mutually intruding fluids of lock-exchange flow, solutions to the shallow-water equations can be obtained only through the specification of front conditions. In the present paper, analytic solutions to the shallow-water equations for non-Boussinesq lock-exchange flow are given for front conditions deriving from free-boundary arguments. Analytic solutions are also derived for other proposed front conditions - conditions which appear to the shallow-water system as forced boundary conditions. Both solutions to the shallow-water equations are compared with the numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and a mixture of successes and failures is recorded. The apparent success of some aspects of the forced solutions of the shallow-water equations, together with the fact that in a real fluid the density interface is a free boundary, shows the need for an improved theory of lock-exchange flow taking into account non-hydrostatic effects for density interfaces intersecting rigid boundaries."	0022-1120		MAY	2011	675					1	26		10.1017/jfm.2010.648

The relationship between statistics of warm-season cloud episodes and synoptic weather regimes over the East Asian continent	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS									"In this study, the relationship between statistical properties (including zonal span, duration, and propagation speed) of warm-season cloud episodes in Hovmoller space and synoptic conditions over the East Asian continent is investigated for the period of May-July 1997-2002. Synoptic conditions are classified into four regimes: those with baroclinity only at lower level (L), only at upper level (U), at both lower and upper levels (B), or at neither level (N), and cloud streaks (i.e., episodes as identified through an automated procedure) in each regime are stratified based on their zonal span (length in the East-West direction). It is found that there exists a tendency for episodes in regime B to be larger than episodes in regime N. For larger and less frequent episodes with a zonal span more than about 1,400 km, low-level conditions appear to have slightly higher importance than upper-level conditions, as streaks in regime L tend to be larger than those in regime U. Overall, the results point to the possibility that both upper-level steering and low-level features are important for major episodes that propagate at the leeside of the Tibetan Plateau for long distances across the East Asian continent. A better understanding of the episode behavior in the area is important for future application to improve the quantitative precipitation forecasts in warm season."	0177-7971		MAY	2011	112	3-4				117	124		10.1007/s00703-011-0123-2

The sensitivity of momentum transport and severe surface winds to environmental moisture in idealized simulations of a mesoscale convective system	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Analysis of a pair of three-dimensional simulations of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) reveals a significant sensitivity of convective momentum transport (CMT), MCS motion, and the generation of severe surface winds to ambient moisture. The Weather Research and Forecasting model is used to simulate an idealized MCS, which is compared with an MCS in a drier midlevel environment. The MCS in the drier environment is smaller, moves slightly faster, and exhibits increased descent and more strongly focused areas of enhanced CMT near the surface in the trailing stratiform region relative to that in the control simulation. A marked increase in the occurrence of severe surface winds is observed between the dry midlevel simulation and the control. It is shown that the enhanced downward motion associated with decreased midlevel relative humidity affects CMT fields and contributes to an increase in the number of grid-cell occurrences of severe surface winds. The role of a descending rear-inflow jet in producing strong surface winds at locations trailing the gust front is also analyzed, and is found to be associated with low-level CMT maxima, particularly in the drier midlevel simulation."	0027-0644		MAY	2011	139	5				1352	1369		10.1175/2010MWR3468.1

The models use the same initial and lateral boundary conditions, and standard parameterizations for turbulence, radiation, and land surface processes. The evolution of the mean along-valley wind (averaged over the valley cross section) is similar for all models, except for a time shift between individual models of up to 2 h and slight differences in the speed of the evolution. The analysis suggests that these differences are primarily due to differences in the simulated surface energy balance such as the dependence of the sensible heat flux on surface wind speed. Additional sensitivity experiments indicate that the evolution of the mean along-valley flow is largely independent of the choice of the dynamical core and of the turbulence parameterization scheme. The latter does, however, have a significant influence on the vertical structure of the boundary layer and of the along-valley wind. Thus, this ideal case may be useful for testing and evaluation of mesoscale numerical models with respect to land surface atmosphere interactions and turbulence parameterizations."	0027-0644		MAY	2011	139	5				1389	1409		10.1175/2010MWR3523.1

All three second-order advection schemes control the nonlinear energy cascade in case of nondivergent flow by conserving quadratic quantities. Linearization of all three schemes leads to the same second-order linear advection scheme. The second-order term of the truncation error of the linear advection scheme has a special form so that it can be eliminated by modifying the advected quantity while still preserving consistency. Tests with linear advection of a cone confirm the advantage of the fourth-order scheme. However, if a localized, large amplitude and high wave-number pattern is present in initial conditions, the clear advantage of the fourth-order scheme disappears. The new nonlinear fourth-order schemes are quadratic conservative and reduce to the Arakawa Jacobian for advected quantities in case of nondivergent flow. In case of general flow the conservation properties of the new momentum advection schemes impose stricter constraint on the nonlinear cascade than the original second-order schemes. However, for nondivergent flow, the conservation properties of the fourth-order schemes cannot be proven in the same way as those of the original second-order schemes. Therefore, demanding long-term and low-resolution nonlinear tests were carried out in order to investigate how well the fourth-order schemes control the nonlinear energy cascade. All schemes were able to maintain meaningful solutions throughout the test. Finally, the impact was examined of the fourth-order momentum advection on global medium-range forecasts. The 500-hPa anomaly correlation coefficient obtained using the best performing fourth-order scheme did not show an improvement compared to the tests using its second-order counterpart."	0027-0644		MAY	2011	139	5				1556	1568		10.1175/2010MWR3448.1

Heat waves have had debilitating effects on human mortality, and global climate models predict an increase in the frequency and severity of heat waves. The extent to which climate change will harm human health through changes in the distribution of heat waves and the sources of uncertainty in estimating these effects have not been studied extensively. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the future excess mortality attributable to heat waves under global climate change for a major U.S. city. METHODS: We used a database comprising daily data from 1987 through 2005 on mortality from all nonaccidental causes, ambient levels of particulate matter and ozone, temperature, and dew point temperature for the city of Chicago, Illinois. We estimated the associations between heat waves and mortality in Chicago using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Under three different climate change scenarios for 2081-2100 and in the absence of adaptation, the city of Chicago could experience between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year attributable to heat waves, based on estimates from seven global climate models. We noted considerable variability in the projections of annual heat wave mortality; the largest source of variation was the choice of climate model.

Dust events were observed from March 16 to 20, 2006 in the Mexico City (MC) area during the MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations) field experiment. In order to study the effects of dust aerosols on total aerosol mass concentrations and photochemistry, a regional chemical/dynamical model (Weather Research and Forecasting Chemical model version 3 - WRF/Chem-v3) was used in this study, and a dust module was implemented in the model. Analysis of model and observational data suggests that the large area of coastal dry lands to the northeast of MC is an important source of dust particles for the entire MC area. The simulations of both PM(2.5) (total particle mass with radius less than 2.5 mu m) and PM(10) (total particle mass with radius less than 10 mu m) concentrations are more consistent with observations than the results of the model without the dust module. During this dust period (March 16-20, 2006), the simulated dust aerosol mass accounts for about 70% of the total PM(10) aerosol mass concentrations, with a strong diurnal variation. The results also suggest that dust aerosols have important effects on actinic fluxes and therefore photochemistry, especially on hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations, in the MC area and the surrounding region. The dust particles decrease the photochemical production of OH, with a maximum reduction of 60% in the dust source region (northeast of the MC area).

Global cloud climatological studies based on active remote sensing data sets benefit from more accurate resolution of vertical structure and more reliable detection of optically thin layers. The mean values for cirrus cases over North China are 0.19 +/- 0.18 for infrared emittance, 0.41 +/- 0.68 for visible optical depth, 0.26 +/- 0.12 for integrated depolarization ratio, and 0.72 +/- 0.22 for integrated color ratio. When studied using reasonable assumptions for the relationship between extinction and ice crystal backscatter coefficients, our results show that most of the cirrus clouds profiled using the 0.532 mu m channel data stream correspond with an optical depth of less than 1.0. The dependence of cirrus cloud properties on cirrus cloud mid-cloud temperature and geometry thickness are generally similar to the results derived from the ground-based lidar, which are mainly impacted by the adiabatic process on the ice cloud content. However, the differences in macrophysical parameter variability indicate the limits of spaceborne-lidar and dissimilarities in regional climate variability and the nature and source of cloud nuclei in different geographical regions."	0256-1530		MAY	2011	28	3				653	664		10.1007/s00376-010-0049-5

Linear and non-linear response to parameter variations in a mesoscale model	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY									"Parameter uncertainty in atmospheric model forcing and closure schemes has motivated both parameter estimation with data assimilation and use of pre-specified distributions to simulate model uncertainty in short-range ensemble prediction. This work assesses the potential for parameter estimation and ensemble prediction by analysing 2 months of mesoscale ensemble predictions in which each member uses distinct, and fixed, settings for four model parameters. A space-filling parameter selection design leads to a unique parameter set for each ensemble member. An experiment to test linear scaling between parameter distribution width and ensemble spread shows the lack of a general linear response to parameters. Individual member near-surface spatial means, spatial variances and skill show that perturbed models are typically indistinguishable. Parameter-state rank correlation fields are not statistically significant, although the presence of other sources of noise may mask true correlations. Results suggest that ensemble prediction using perturbed parameters may be a simple complement to more complex model-error simulation methods, but that parameter estimation may prove difficult or costly for real mesoscale numerical weather prediction applications."	0280-6495		MAY	2011	63	3				429	444		10.1111/j.1600-0870.2010.00505.x

A scientific description and verification of several candidate methods for implementation in the U.S. Air Force Weather Agency mesoscale ensemble is presented. Model perturbation methods tested include multiple parametrization suites, land-surface property perturbations, perturbations to parameters within physics schemes and stochastic 'backscatter' stream-function perturbations. IC perturbations considered include perturbed observations in 10 independent WRF-3DVar cycles and the ensemble-transform Kalman filter (ETKF). A hybrid of ETKF (for IC perturbations) and WRF-3DVar (to update the ensemble mean) is also tested. Results show that all of the model and IC perturbation methods examined are more skilful than direct dynamical downscaling of the global ensemble. IC perturbations are most helpful during the first 12 h of the forecasts. Physical parametrization diversity appears critical for boundary-layer forecasts. In an effort to reduce system complexity by reducing the number of suites of physical parametrizations, a smaller set of parametrization suites was combined with perturbed parameters and stochastic backscatter, resulting in the most skilful and statistically consistent ensemble predictions."	0280-6495		MAY	2011	63	3				625	641		10.1111/j.1600-0870.2010.00497.x

This has important impacts on urban ecosystem and photochemistry, especially on ozone photochemical production over the region. The quantitative effect of aerosols on surface ozone is evaluated by analyzing surface observations (including ozone, ultraviolet radiation, aerosol radiative parameters) and by using radiative and chemical models. A case study shows that the aerosol concentrations and UV radiation are significantly correlated with ozone concentrations. The correlation coefficient between the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the PM(10) mass concentration is very high, with a maximum of 0.98, and the AOD and UV radiation/ozone is anticorrelated, with a correlation coefficient of -0.90. The analysis suggests that ozone productivity is significantly decreased due to the reduction of UV radiation. The noon-time ozone maximum is considerably depressed when AOD is 0.6, and is further decreased when AOD is up to 1.2 due to the reduction of ozone photochemical productivity. Because the occurring probability of aerosol optical depth for AOD(550 nm)a (c) 3/40.6 and AOD(340 nm)a (c) 3/41.0 is 47, and 55% respectively during the dry season (October, November, December, January), this heavy aerosol condition explains the low ozone maximum that often occurs in the dry season over the Guangzhou region. The analysis also suggests that the value of single scattering albedo (SSA) is very sensitive to the aerosol radiative effect when the radiative and chemical models are applied, implying that the value of SSA needs to be carefully studied when the models are used in calculating ozone production."	1674-7313		MAY	2011	54	5				744	752		10.1007/s11430-011-4172-7

Our focus is on the leading two empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of subsurface temperature variability, which together produce an eastward propagating mode. Predictability is measured by relative entropy, which compares both the mean and spread of predictions of ensembles to the model's climatological distribution of states. Despite the fact that EOF1, which is structurally similar to the observational Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), has pronounced spectral peaks on decadal time scales, its predictability is less than 6 years. Additional predictability resides in the tendency of EOF1 to evolve to EOF2, primarily through simple advective processes. The propagating mode represented by the combination of EOF1 and EOF2 is predictable for about a decade. Information in both the mean and spread of predicted ensembles contribute to this predictability. Among the leading 15 EOFs, EOF1 is the least predictable mode in terms of the rate at which the corresponding principal component disperses in the ensemble experiments. However, it can produce enhanced predictability of the whole system by inducing EOF2, which is one of the two EOFs with the slowest dispersion rate. The first two EOFs can also enhance the ensemble mean (or ""signal"") component of predictability of the entire system. For typical amplitude initial states, this component contributes to predictability for about 6 years. For initial states with unusually high amplitude projections onto these two EOFs, this contribution can last much longer. The major findings from the three ensemble experiments are replicated and generalized when the initial condition predictability for each of many hundreds of different initial states is estimated. These estimates are derived from the behavior of a linear inverse model (LIM) that is based on the intrinsic variability present in the control run."	0930-7575		MAY	2011	36	9-10				1813	1834		10.1007/s00382-010-0749-7

Estimating signal loss in regularized GRACE gravity field solutions	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL									"P>Gravity field solutions produced using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are subject to errors that increase as a function of increasing spatial resolution. Two commonly used techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the gravity field solutions are post-processing, via spectral filters, and regularization, which occurs within the least-squares inversion process used to create the solutions. One advantage of post-processing methods is the ability to easily estimate the signal loss resulting from the application of the spectral filter by applying the filter to synthetic gravity field coefficients derived from models of mass variation. This is a critical step in the construction of an accurate error budget. Estimating the amount of signal loss due to regularization, however, requires the execution of the full gravity field determination process to create synthetic instrument data; this leads to a significant cost in computation and expertise relative to post-processing techniques, and inhibits the rapid development of optimal regularization weighting schemes. Thus, while a number of studies have quantified the effects of spectral filtering, signal modification in regularized GRACE gravity field solutions has not yet been estimated. In this study, we examine the effect of one regularization method. First, we demonstrate that regularization can in fact be performed as a post-processing step if the solution covariance matrix is available. Regularization then is applied as a post-processing step to unconstrained solutions from the Center for Space Research (CSR), using weights reported by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales/Groupe de Recherches de geodesie spatiale (CNES/GRGS). After regularization, the power spectra of the CSR solutions agree well with those of the CNES/GRGS solutions. Finally, regularization is performed on synthetic gravity field solutions derived from a land surface model, revealing that in some locations significant signal loss can result from regularization. This signal loss is similar in magnitude to estimated signal loss in post-filtered solutions. End-users of GRACE data can use this method to improve the error budgets of GRACE time-series, or to restore the power lost through regularization using a scaling technique."	0956-540X		MAY	2011	185	2				693	702		10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.04977.x

The Metrics Challenge asked modelers to submit results for four geomagnetic storm events and five different types of observations that can be modeled by statistical or climatological or physics-based (e. g., MHD) models of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. We present the results of 12 model settings that were run at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center and at the institutions of various modelers for these events. To measure the performance of each of the models against the observations, we use direct comparisons between the strength of the measured magnetic field (B), the sine of the elevation angle Theta(xz) (tau), and the spectral power of fluctuations for both quantities. We find that model rankings vary widely by type of variable and skill score used. None of the models consistently performs best for all events. We find that empirical models perform well for weak storm events, and physics-based (magnetohydrodynamic) models are better for strong storm events. Within a series of runs of the same model we find that higher resolution may not always improve results unless more physics of the inner magnetosphere, such as the kinetic description of the ring current, is included."	1542-7390		APR 28	2011	9							S04005	10.1029/2010SW000617

The envelope curve of central Appalachian flood peaks at ""small"" drainage areas (less than 1000 km(2)) is dominated by orographic thunderstorm systems, like the Smethport storm. Orographic thunderstorm systems that have produced catastrophic flooding in the central Appalachians are examined through observational and numerical model analyses using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Analyses suggest that the frequency of catastrophic flooding varies over the central Appalachian region and that small-scale variation may be linked to the role of complex terrain in altering thunderstorm dynamics. Catastrophic flooding along the western margin of the central Appalachians is dominated by four storms that occurred on 18-19 July (1889, 1942, 1977, and 1996), which were associated with warm season extratropical systems and were characterized by rapidly moving storm elements in complex terrain.

However, it is not well understood whether they occur at all longitudes and what process causes their occurrence at different longitude sectors. In this study, we use the GPS total electron content (TEC) fluctuations obtained from a global GPS network and spread F in ionograms from Jicamarca (283 degrees E, 12 degrees S, Dip 1 degrees N) in the American longitude sector and Kwajalein (167 degrees E, 9 degrees N, Dip 4 degrees N), Bac Lieu (106 degrees E, 9 degrees N, Dip 2 degrees N), and Chumphon (99 degrees E, 11 degrees N, Dip 3 degrees N) in the Pacific and Asian longitude sectors during 2000-2009, to investigate the EFI characteristics during June solstice. Results from global TEC fluctuations show that at solar maximum, the occurrence rate of postmidnight EFIs is high in African and Pacific regions, moderate in the Southeast Asian region, and low in the Peruvian region and that most postmidnight EFIs are the continuation of postsunset EFIs. During solar minimum the postmidnight EFIs were rarely observed in TEC but were very frequent in ionograms. The latter had more frequent postmidnight onsets over Peru, whereas they were initiated during late postsunset hours in Pacific and Southeast Asian longitudes. In both longitudes the postsunset layer rise occurred with some delay. The layer rise was more prominent on spread F nights over Jicamarca and less so over Pacific longitudes. The results showing different degrees of association at the different longitudes between the postsunset/postmidnight EFIs and F layer heights highlight the influence of other factors in the late-night EFI development. Perturbation seeds and plasma drifts/neutral winds, in particular, are discussed as strong candidates for causing these irregularities in the June solstitial months of solar minimum years."	0148-0227		APR 22	2011	116							A04318	10.1029/2010JA016056

Conventional trends (i.e., less negative delta(13)C(R) with increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (T(AIR)), and decreased soil moisture (theta)) were observed when we focused on the driest portions of average-wetness years and when delta(13)C(R) was positively correlated with nighttime ecosystem respiration (R(E)). Nonconventional trends (i.e., more negative delta(13)C(R) with decreased theta, and increased VPD and T(AIR)) were observed under specific climatic conditions (e. g., late snowmelt; extreme T(AIR) late in the growing season), and when delta(13)C(R) was negatively correlated with R(E). These nonconventional trends were independently corroborated using delta(13)C of extracted sugars from needles of dominant tree species at the site. Our results clearly demonstrate that the commonly reported relations between delta(13)C(R) and climate may break down depending on the interactions among environmental conditions. Efforts to model and predict the variability of delta(13)C(R) under changing climatic variables must characterize and parameterize the effects of unique combinations of weather conditions and variable hydrologic regimes, in combination with the susceptibility of photosynthetic isotope discrimination to extreme air temperatures."	0148-0227		APR 22	2011	116							G02005	10.1029/2010JG001556

Seasonal and longitudinal variations of the solar quiet (Sq) current system during solar minimum determined by CHAMP satellite magnetic field observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"[1] Vector magnetometer observations from the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite are used to determine the solar quiet (Sq) current system during the recent solar minimum. Observations from 2006 to 2008 are combined, and after removal of a main field model and accounting for field-aligned currents, the longitudinal and seasonal variation of the Sq currents are determined through the method of spherical harmonic analysis. Comparison with Sq currents derived from ground-based magnetometers in the African/European longitude sector reveals similar amplitudes and seasonal variations, indicating that the CHAMP observations can reliably determine the Sq current system. The seasonal variation is consistent with prior observations during solar minimum conditions and in the Northern Hemisphere exhibits a primarily annual variation with peak currents during local summer. The seasonal variation in the Southern Hemisphere is characterized by a semiannual variation with the maxima occurring around the equinoxes. Significant longitudinal variations are also observed, and they display a seasonal variability. During Northern Hemisphere summer, the predominant feature at local noon is a wave number 1 variation in longitude. During the remainder of the year, a wave 3 longitudinal structure is observed at this local time. The longitudinal variations are considered to be due to a combination of the orientation and strength of the geomagnetic field as well as the tidal winds in the lower thermosphere. Variations in tidal winds due to nonmigrating tides may influence the dynamo-generated electric fields and currents, resulting in the observed longitudinal variations of the Sq current function."	0148-0227		APR 21	2011	116							A04317	10.1029/2010JA016289

Simulated impacts of irrigation on the atmospheric circulation over Asia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We find that irrigation significantly affects Asian summer climate, according to model simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3.0) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM3.5). Irrigation over the major river basins in the Middle East and central Asia causes a decrease in sensible heat fluxes and an increase in latent heat fluxes in boreal summer. These changes in heat fluxes lead to a cooling of both the surface and the lower troposphere over the irrigated regions. This atmospheric cooling, in turn, results in a cooling of the layer-averaged temperature (thickness temperature) in the troposphere. The irrigation-induced cooling in the troposphere, therefore, significantly decreases the tropospheric geopotential height over the irrigated regions. Lower height in the upper troposphere alters the upper-level atmospheric circulation over the irrigated and surrounding regions in Asia. Cyclonic differences of atmospheric circulation are simulated around negative differences of height and positive differences of vorticity between the irrigated and control runs, and they result in a weakening of the upper-level anticyclonic circulation over the tropical to midlatitude African-Asian regions. These changes in atmospheric circulation lead to a weakening of the strong upper-level westerly jet (Asian jet) over eastern Europe, the Middle East, and central Asia in 40 degrees N similar to 55 degrees N. The irrigation impacts on the atmospheric circulation and Asian jet in boreal summer are supported by a comparison with observations."	0148-0227		APR 21	2011	116							D08114	10.1029/2010JD014740

Among them is the Alfven-cyclotron wave, which is probably responsible for the solar wind plasma heating, but has not yet been identified from the magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence. Here, we present the possible signatures of Alfven-cyclotron waves in the distribution of magnetic helicity as a function of theta(VB), which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and local mean magnetic field. We use magnetic field data from the STEREO spacecraft to calculate the theta(VB) distribution of the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity sigma(m). We find a dominant negative sigma(m) for 1 s < p < 4 s (p is time period) and for theta(VB) < 30 degrees in the solar wind outward magnetic sector, and a dominant positive sigma(m) for 0.4 s < p < 4 s and for theta(VB) > 150 degrees in the solar wind inward magnetic sector. These features of sigma(m) appearing around the Doppler-shifted ion-cyclotron frequencies may be consistent with the existence of Alfven-cyclotron waves among the outward propagating fluctuations. Moreover, right-handed polarized waves at larger propagation angles, which might be kinetic Alfven-waves or whistler waves, have also been identified on the basis of the sigma(m) features in the angular range 40 degrees < theta(VB) < 140 degrees.

Temporal relation between theE disappearance of penumbral fine-scale structure and Evershed flow	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"We investigate the temporal relation between the Evershed flow, dot-like bright features (penumbral grain), the complex magnetic field structure, and dark lanes (dark core) along bright filaments in a sunspot penumbra. We use a time series of high spatial resolution photospheric intensity, vector magnetic field maps, and Doppler velocity maps obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope aboard the Hinode spacecraft. We conclude that the appearance and disappearance of the Evershed flow and penumbra grains occur at nearly the same time and are associated with changes of the inclination angle of the magnetic field from vertical to more horizontal. This supports the idea that Evershed flow is a result of thermal convection in the inclined field lines. The dark core of the bright penumbral filament also appears coincidental with the Evershed flow. However, the dark-cored bright filament survives at least for 10-20 minutes after the disappearance of the Evershed flow. The heat input into the bright filament continues even after the end of heat transfer by the Evershed flow. This suggests that local heating along the bright filament is important for maintaining its brightness, in addition to heat transfer by the Evershed flow."	0004-637X		APR 20	2011	731	2						84	10.1088/0004-637X/731/2/84

A case study of an elevated stratopause generated in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is used to study the influence of gravity waves on the generation and evolution of an elevated stratopause following a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). By comparing WACCM simulations of two Arctic winters, where one is dynamically undisturbed and one is disturbed, we find that intense planetary wave activity during a SSW drives the reversal of the zonal mean wind in the stratosphere. This alters the penetration of eastward propagating, non-orographic gravity waves into the mesosphere, which determine the extent of cooling in the lower mesosphere and upper stratosphere through the adiabatic effects of the gravity wave-driven residual circulation, and play a crucial role in the reformation of the elevated stratopause in the lower mesosphere. Eventually, the forcing due to gravity waves returns to normal wintertime values as the stratospheric zonal wind recovers, and is then associated with the warming and lowering of the elevated stratopause, by wave induced diabatic descent. We find that SSW followed by an elevated stratopause is a climatologically robust phenomenon in free running WACCM with characteristics closely resembling recently observed events in the Arctic.

"Emissions of black carbon, organic, and inorganic aerosols from biomass burning in North America and Asia in 2008"	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Reliable assessment of the impact of aerosols emitted from boreal forest fires on the Arctic climate necessitates improved understanding of emissions and the microphysical properties of carbonaceous (black carbon (BC) and organic aerosols (OA)) and inorganic aerosols. The size distributions of BC were measured by an SP2 based on the laser-induced incandescence technique on board the DC-8 aircraft during the NASA ARCTAS campaign. Aircraft sampling was made in fresh plumes strongly impacted by wildfires in North America (Canada and California) in summer 2008 and in those transported from Asia (Siberia in Russia and Kazakhstan) in spring 2008. We extracted biomass burning plumes using particle and tracer (CO, CH(3)CN, and CH(2)Cl(2)) data. OA constituted the dominant fraction of aerosols mass in the submicron range. The large majority of the emitted particles did not contain BC. We related the combustion phase of the fire as represented by the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) to the emission ratios between BC and other species. In particular, we derived the average emission ratios of BC/CO = 2.3 +/- 2.2 and 8.5 +/- 5.4 ng m(-3)/ppbv for BB in North America and Asia, respectively. The difference in the BC/CO emission ratios is likely due to the difference in MCE. The count median diameters and geometric standard deviations of the lognormal size distribution of BC in the BB plumes were 136-141 nm and 1.32-1.36, respectively, and depended little on MCE. These BC particles were thickly coated, with shell/core ratios of 1.3-1.6. These parameters can be used directly for improving model estimates of the impact of BB in the Arctic."	0148-0227		APR 19	2011	116							D08204	10.1029/2010JD015152

Modeling the multiday evolution and aging of secondary organic aerosol during MILAGRO 2006	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY									"In this study, we apply several recently proposed models to the evolution of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and organic gases advected from downtown Mexico City at: an altitude of similar to 3.5 km during three days of aging, in a way that is directly comparable to simulations in regional and global models. We constrain the model with and compare its results to available observations. The model SOA formed from oxidation of volatile organic compounds (V-SOA) when using a non-aging SOA parameterization cannot explain the observed SOA concentrations in aged pollution, despite the increasing importance of the low-NO, channel. However, when using an aging SOA parameterization, V-SOA alone is similar to the regional aircraft observations, highlighting the wide diversity in current V-SOA formulations. When the SOA formed from oxidation of semivolatile and intermediate volatility organic vapors (SI-SOA) is computed following Robinson et al. (2007) the model matches the observed SOA mass, but its 0/C is similar to 2 x too low. With the parameterization of Grieshop et al. (2009), the total SOA mass is similar to 2 x too high, but 0/C and volatility are closer to the observations. Heating or dilution cause the evaporation of a substantial fraction of the model SOA; this fraction is reduced by aging although differently for heating vs dilution. Lifting of the airmass to the free-troposphere during dry convection substantially increases SOA by condensation of semivolatile vapors; this effect is reduced by aging."	0013-936X		APR 15	2011	45	8				3496	3503		10.1021/es103186f

"Atmospheric emissions from the Deepwater Horizon spill constrain air-water partitioning, hydrocarbon fate, and leak rate"	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"The fate of deepwater releases of gas and oil mixtures is initially determined by solubility and volatility of individual hydrocarbon species; these attributes determine partitioning between air and water. Quantifying this partitioning is necessary to constrain simulations of gas and oil transport, to predict marine bioavailability of different fractions of the gas-oil mixture, and to develop a comprehensive picture of the fate of leaked hydrocarbons in the marine environment. Analysis of airborne atmospheric data shows massive amounts (similar to 258,000 kg/day) of hydrocarbons evaporating promptly from the Deepwater Horizon spill; these data collected during two research flights constrain air-water partitioning, thus bioavailability and fate, of the leaked fluid. This analysis quantifies the fraction of surfacing hydrocarbons that dissolves in the water column (similar to 33% by mass), the fraction that does not dissolve, and the fraction that evaporates promptly after surfacing (similar to 14% by mass). We do not quantify the leaked fraction lacking a surface expression; therefore, calculation of atmospheric mass fluxes provides a lower limit to the total hydrocarbon leak rate of 32,600 to 47,700 barrels of fluid per day, depending on reservoir fluid composition information. This study demonstrates a new approach for rapid-response airborne assessment of future oil spills. Citation: Ryerson, T. B., et al.

The temporal variation of the WRF model-simulated rain rate is in good agreement with the observed data. The sensitivity experiments with ice runs and ice-free runs show that the ice run can produce less rain prior to and during the onset of the monsoon period: the mean decrease can be -5 mm d(-1) and the maximum decrease can be more than 60 mm d-1 during the post onset of the monsoon period, and about 6% decrease of the domain-averaged accumulative rainfall. The mechanism that induces this phenomenon was investigated through the budget of cloud radiation forcing, the variations of latent heating and cooling, and that of terminal fall velocities of cloud hydrometeors due to phase change in this paper, and show that at the top of atmosphere the net cloud radiation forcing on both ice cloud and water cloud can be neglected. However, on the ocean surface the ice run may reduce about 14% of downward shortwave radiation and increase about 1.6% of downward longwave radiation on average, which can produce a net cooling process and directly reduce the sensible and latent heat fluxes on the ocean surface and result in the decrease of precipitation over the whole region. Therefore, the effect of ice microphysics is dominated through the radiation processes instead of microphysics itself. In addition, ice cloud can lead to the atmosphere being warmer and drier at middle and upper levels and stabilize the atmosphere and suppress the further development of convections."	0148-0227		APR 14	2011	116							D07108	10.1029/2010JD014662

They evolve over time, eventually erupting as the dark cores of coronal mass ejections(2,3). Although coronal mass ejections are common and can significantly affect planetary magnetospheres, the mechanisms by which cavities evolve to an eruptive state remain poorly understood. Recent optical observations(4) of high-latitude 'polar crown' prominences within coronal cavities reveal dark, low-density(5) 'bubbles' that undergo Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities(6,7) to form dark plumes rising into overlying coronal cavities. These observations offered a possible mechanism for coronal cavity evolution, although the nature of the bubbles, particularly their buoyancy, was hitherto unclear. Here we report simultaneous optical and extreme-ultraviolet observations of polar crown prominences that show that these bubbles contain plasma at temperatures in the range (2.5-12) x 10(5) kelvin, which is 25-120 times hotter than the overlying prominence. This identifies a source of the buoyancy, and suggests that the coronal cavity-prominence system supports a novel form of magneto-thermal convection in the solar atmosphere, challenging current hydromagnetic concepts of prominences and their relation to coronal cavities."	0028-0836		APR 14	2011	472	7342				197	200		10.1038/nature09925

Progress in observations and simulations of global change in the upper atmosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"Anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases warm the troposphere but have a cooling effect in the middle and upper atmosphere. The steady increase of CO(2) is the dominant cause of upper atmosphere trends; other drivers are long-term changes of radiatively active trace gases such as CH(4), O(3), and H(2)O, secular change of solar and geomagnetic activity, and evolution of the Earth's magnetic field. Observational and model studies have confirmed that in the past several decades, global cooling has occurred in the mesosphere and thermosphere; the cooling and contraction of the upper atmosphere has lowered the ionosphere and increased electron density in the E and F(1) regions. Trends of other parameters, including the F(2) region, mesospheric clouds, and mesopause wave activity, have been more controversial. Modeling investigations have demonstrated that both greenhouse gas forcing and secular change of the Earth's magnetic field can cause regional, diurnal, and seasonal variability of trends in F(2) region density and height, which may contribute to discrepancies regarding ionospheric trends. Recent studies also may have reconciled discrepancies between space-based and ground-based observations of mesospheric clouds: both types of observations do not find statistically significant trends in the similar to 54 degrees N-similar to 64 degrees N latitude region, but space-based observations indicate that clouds may be increasing in frequency at higher latitude. Limited observational studies have suggested possible trends in wave activity. Changes in atmospheric dynamics, both as a consequence of global change in the lower and middle atmosphere and as a possible driver of trends in the upper atmosphere, is one of the critical open questions regarding trends in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere."	0148-0227		APR 13	2011	116							A00H03	10.1029/2010JA016317

Some appear to undergo magnetic cycles similar to the 22 yr solar activity cycle. We conduct simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore dynamo action achieved in the convective envelope of a solar-type star rotating at five times the current solar rotation rate. We find that dynamo action builds substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields in the midst of the convection zone. Striking magnetic wreaths span the convection zone and coexist with the turbulent convection. A surprising feature of this wreath-building dynamo is its rich time dependence. The dynamo exhibits cyclic activity and undergoes quasi-periodic polarity reversals where both the global-scale poloidal and toroidal fields change in sense on a roughly 1500 day timescale. These magnetic activity patterns emerge spontaneously from the turbulent flow and are more organized temporally and spatially than those realized in our previous simulations of the solar dynamo. We assess in detail the competing processes of magnetic field creation and destruction within our simulations that contribute to the global-scale reversals. We find that the mean toroidal fields are built primarily through an Omega-effect, while the mean poloidal fields are built by turbulent correlations which are not well represented by a simple alpha-effect. During a reversal the magnetic wreaths propagate toward the polar regions, and this appears to arise from a poleward propagating dynamo wave. As the magnetic fields wax and wane in strength and flip in polarity, the primary response in the convective flows involves the axisymmetric differential rotation which varies on similar timescales. Bands of relatively fast and slow fluid propagate toward the poles on timescales of roughly 500 days and are associated with the magnetic structures that propagate in the same fashion. In the Sun, similar patterns are observed in the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations, and these may represent poleward propagating magnetic fields deep below the solar surface."	0004-637X		APR 10	2011	731	1						69	10.1088/0004-637X/731/1/69

The impact of North American anthropogenic emissions and lightning on long-range transport of trace gases and their export from the continent during summers 2002 and 2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We analyze the contribution of North American (NA) lightning and anthropogenic emissions to ozone concentrations, radiative forcing, and export fluxes from North America during summers 2002 and 2004 using the University of Maryland Chemical Transport Model (UMD-CTM) driven by GEOS-4 reanalysis. Reduced power plant emissions (NO(x) SIP Call) and cooler temperatures in 2004 compared to 2002 resulted in lower ambient ozone concentrations over the eastern United States. Lightning flash rates in early summer 2004 were 50% higher than 2002 over the United States. Over the North Atlantic, changes in ozone column between early summer 2002 and 2004 due to changes in lightning and meteorology exceeded the change due to emission reductions by a factor of 7. Late summer changes in lightning had a much smaller impact on ozone columns. In summer 2004, net downward radiative flux at the tropopause due to ozone produced from anthropogenic emissions ranged from 0.15 to 0.30 W m(-2) across the North Atlantic, while that due to ozone produced from lightning NO emissions ranged from 0.20 to 0.50 W m(-2). Enhanced lofting of polluted air followed by stronger westerly winds led to more net export of NO(x), NO(y), and ozone in early summer 2004 than 2002 despite reduced anthropogenic emissions. Ozone export fluxes across the eastern NA boundary due to anthropogenic emissions were factors of 1.6 and 2 larger than those due to lightning in 2004 and 2002, respectively. Doubling the NA lightning NO source increased downwind ozone enhancements due to lightning NO emissions by one third."	0148-0227		APR 7	2011	116							D07305	10.1029/2010JD014305

The role of boundary layer dynamics on the diurnal evolution of isoprene and the hydroxyl radical over tropical forests	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We investigate diurnal variability of isoprene and related chemical species in the Amazonian region. The dynamics and chemistry of an atmospheric boundary layer are studied with a large-eddy simulation code and a mixed-layer model which are guided by observations available for the same area. The main features of isoprene and related species are reproduced well, but their evolution raises questions regarding the physical and chemical processes responsible for the observed diurnal behaviors. To address these questions, we systematically examine the role of (1) the exchange of chemical species between the free troposphere and the atmospheric boundary layer (entrainment), (2) surface isoprene and nitric oxide emissions, and (3) new chemical pathways to recycle the hydroxyl radical. The entrainment flux of isoprene is shown to be equally important as surface isoprene emissions in determining the isoprene temporal evolution. Varying the relationship between the initial isoprene mixing ratio in the boundary layer and that in the overlying free troposphere in the early morning results in an 50% increase/decrease in isoprene mixing ratio or more within the atmospheric boundary layer at noon. Entrainment of free tropospheric nitrogen oxides creates changes of similar magnitude to the boundary layer isoprene mixing ratio. These effects of entrainment and surface emissions on isoprene are found for two different chemical regimes. The introduction of an OH recycling pathway in the chemical mechanism increases midday OH. Our findings show that atmospheric dynamics and chemistry are equally important for interpreting the diurnal observation of reactants and for including in regional-scale modeling efforts where turbulence is parameterized."	0148-0227		APR 6	2011	116							D07304	10.1029/2010JD014857

This modeling system is built upon the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) community Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF has been enhanced with the NCAR Real-Time Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (RTFDDA) capability. FDDA is an effective data assimilation algorithm, which is capable of assimilating diverse weather measurements on model grids and seamlessly providing realistic mesoscale weather forcing to drive a large eddy simulation (LES) model within the WRF framework. The WRF based RTFDDA LES modeling capability is referred to as WRF-RTFDDA-LES. In this study, WRF-RTFDDA-LES is employed to simulate real weather in a major wind farm located in northern Colorado with six nested domains. The grid sizes of the nested domains are 30, 10, 3.3, 1.1, 0.370 and 0.123 km, respectively. The model results are compared with wind-farm anemometer measurements and are found to capture many intra-farm wind features and microscale flows. Additional experiments are conducted to investigate the impacts of subgrid scale (SGS) mixing parameters and nesting approaches. This study demonstrates that the WRF-RTFDDA-LES system is a valuable tool for simulating real world microscale weather flows and for development of future real-time forecasting system, although further LES modeling refinements, such as adaptive SGS mixing parameterization and wall-effect modeling, are highly desired.

We study the impact of this technique with a case study in the rolling topography of central Pennsylvania. We compare wind profiles between the mesoscale model alone, the CFD model alone, and the fully assimilated mesoscale/CFD solution. In addition, we examine the impact of the mesoscale assimilation into the CFD model on the fine-scale flow structure.

(137)Cs concentrations in the global ocean can be simulated by global integration of the coarse-resolution Parallel Ocean Program to understand the mechanism of material transport in the ocean. We investigated the transport mechanism of (137)Cs to the Southern Hemisphere using an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) and compared the simulated results with observations of (137)Cs concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere. (137)Cs was deposited on the ocean surface mainly as global fallout originating from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1945, and the global distribution of cumulative (137)Cs deposition has been reconstructed from global measurements of (137)Cs in rain, seawater, and soil. We estimated the global distribution of (137)Cs deposition from 1945 to 2003 using these distribution data, (137)Cs deposition data observed at the Meteorological Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan, from 1958 to 2003, and (137)Cs deposition data for 1945-1957 estimated from ice-core data. We compared the simulated results with (137)Cs sections from the South Pacific, Indian, and South Atlantic Oceans obtained during the BEAGLE2003 cruise in 2003. The simulated (137)Cs sections were in good agreement with the observations, except for the effects of mesoscale eddies, which not be simulated by the model because of its coarse resolution. OGCMs can simulate the general pattern of (137)Cs distribution in the world's oceans and improve our understanding of the transport mechanism leading to those (137)Cs distributions on a time scale of several decades. The model simulation results suggest that the (137)Cs deposited in the North Pacific advected to the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, and then to the South Atlantic over about four decades. The North Pacific is thus an important source area of (137)Cs to the Southern Hemisphere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation using radar and gauge data shows that this configuration of WRF with three-dimensional variational data assimilation of local weather and GPS precipitable water data can simulate this event generally well. Additional WRF simulations were conducted to test the sensitivity of simulation of this storm to different urban processes and urban land-use scenarios. The results confirm that the city does play an important role in determining storm movement and rainfall amount. Comparison of cases with and without the presence of the city of Beijing with respect to the approaching storm shows that the urban effect seems to lead to the breaking of the squall line into convective cells over the urban area. The change of precipitation amount depends on the degree of urbanization (i.e., the change over time in the extent of Beijing city). Model results show that an early urbanization prior to 1980 decreases the maximum rainfall, whereas further urbanization in Beijing is conducive to bifurcating the path of rainfall. According to sensitivity results with a single-layer urban canopy model, the thermal transport (sensible and latent heating) induced by the presence of an urban area apparently is more important than associated momentum transport, with latent and sensible heating apparently having equally important roles in the modification of simulated precipitation. Urban surfaces tend to cause the rainfall to be more locally concentrated. High-rise urban cores may bifurcate the path of rainfall as well as increase the area percentage of heavy rainfall."	1558-8424		APR	2011	50	4				806	825		10.1175/2010JAMC2513.1

Wind profiler observations of mountain waves and r+E327otors during T-REX	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY									"A network of three boundary layer radar wind profilers is used to study characteristics of mountain waves and rotors and to explore the utility of such a network. The data employed were collected as part of the Terrain-Induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX), which took place in Owens Valley, California, in early 2006. The wind profilers provide a continuous time height representation of wave and rotor structure. During intensive observing period 3 (IOP 3), the profiler network was positioned in an L-shaped configuration. capturing key features of the mountain waves and rotor, including the boundary layer vortex sheet (or shear layer), turbulence within this shear layer, the classical lower turbulence zone (LTZ), and wave motion above the LTZ. Observed features were found to be in good agreement with recent high-resolution numerical simulations. Using the wind profiler with superior time resolution (Multiple Antenna Profiler Radar), a series of updraft-downdraft couplets were observed beneath the first downwind wave crest. These are interpreted as signatures of subrotors. Such detailed observations of subrotors are rare, even though subrotors are believed to be a common feature of rotor circulations in Owens Valley. During IOP 6, the network was repositioned to form a line across the valley. A simple algorithm was used to determine the amplitude, wavelength, and phase of the primary wave over the valley and to observe their changes over time and height. In the IOP-6 case, the wavelength increased over time, the phase indicated an eastward-shifting wave crest, and the amplitude increased with height and also varied over time."	1558-8424		APR	2011	50	4				826	843		10.1175/2010JAMC2611.1

The PHIPS produces images of single airborne ice crystals, illuminated with white light of an ultrafast flash-lamp, which are captured at a maximum frequency of similar to 5 Hz by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with microscope optics. The imaging properties of the instrument were characterized by means of crystalline sodium hexafluorosilicate ice analogs, which are stable at room temperature. The optical resolving power of the system is similar to 2 mu m. By using dedicated algorithms for image processing and analysis, the ice crystal images can be analyzed automatically in terms of size and selected shape parameters.

The leading mode, which appears preferentially in summers preceding the peak phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, involves a circumglobal teleconnection (COT) pattern in the NH extratropical 200-hPa height field observed in association with Indian monsoon rainfall anomalies. The second mode, which tends to occur in summers following ENSO peak phases, involves a western Pacific North America (WPNA) teleconnection pattern in the height field observed in association with western North Pacific summer monsoon rainfall anomalies. The CGT pattern is primarily a zonally oriented wave train along the westerly waveguide, while the WPNA pattern is a wave train emanating from the western Pacific monsoon trough and following a great circle. The COT is accompanied by a pronounced tropical extratropical seesaw in the zonally symmetric geopotential height and temperature fields, and the WPNA is observed in association with hemispherically uniform anomalies. These ENSO-related features modulate surface air temperature in both the tropics and extratropics. ENSO also affects the wave structure of the COT and WPNA indirectly, by modulating the strengths of the Indian and western North Pacific monsoons. Linear barotropic mechanisms, including energy propagation and barotropic instability of the basic-state flow, also act to shape and maintain the COT. The implications of these findings for seasonal prediction of the NH extratropical circulation are discussed."	0894-8755		APR 1	2011	24	7				1878	1896		10.1175/2011JCLI3621.1

The current study applies sophisticated double-moment warm-rain and ice microphysics schemes, which allow for a significantly more realistic representation of the impact of aerosols on precipitation processes and on the coupling between clouds and radiative transfer. Two contrasting cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics are assumed, representing pristine and polluted conditions, as well as contrasting representations of the effects of entrainment and mixing on the mean cloud droplet size. In addition, four sets of sensitivity simulations are also performed with changes that provide a reference for the main simulation set. As in the previous study, the CRQE mimics the estimates of globally and annually averaged water and energy fluxes across the earth's atmosphere. There are some differences from the previous study, however, consistent with the slightly lower water vapor content in the troposphere and significantly reduced lower-tropospheric cloud fraction in current simulations. There is also a significant reduction of the difference between the pristine and polluted cases, from similar to 20 to similar to 4 W m(-2) at the surface from similar to 20 to similar to 9 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The difference between the homogeneous and extremely inhomogeneous mixing scenarios, similar to 20 W m(-2) in the previous study, is reduced to a mere 2 (1) W m(-2) at the surface (TOA). An unexpected difference between the previous and current simulations is the lower Bowen ratio of the surface heat flux, the partitioning of the total flux into sensible and latent components. It is shown that most of the change comes from the difference in the representation of rain evaporation in the subcloud layer in the single- and double-moment microphysics schemes. The difference affects the mean air temperature and humidity near the surface, and thus the Bowen ratio. The differences between the various simulations are discussed, contrasting the process-level approach with the impact of cloud microphysics on the quasi-equilibrium state with a more appropriate system dynamics approach. The key distinction is that the latter includes the interactions among all the processes in the modeled system."	0894-8755		APR 1	2011	24	7				1897	1912		10.1175/2010JCLI3647.1

The regional models represent most indices of extreme temperature well. For extreme precipitation, finer grid spacing considerably improves the match to observations. Three regional models, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) at 12- and 36-km grid spacing and the Hadley Centre Regional Model (HadRM) at 25-km grid spacing, are forced with global reanalysis fields over the U.S. Pacific Northwest during 2003-07. The reanalysis data represent the timing of rain-bearing storms over the Pacific Northwest well; however, the reanalysis has the worst performance at simulating both extreme precipitation indices and extreme temperature indices when compared to the WRF and HadRM simulations. These results suggest that the reanalysis data and, by extension, global climate model simulations are not sufficient for examining local extreme precipitations and temperatures owing to their coarse resolutions. Nevertheless, the large-scale forcing is adequately represented by the reanalysis so that regional models may simulate the terrain interactions and mesoscale processes that generate the observed local extremes and frequencies of extreme temperature and precipitation."	0894-8755		APR 1	2011	24	7				1950	1964		10.1175/2010JCLI3224.1

A regional modeling study of climate change impacts on warm-season precipitation in the Central United States	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is employed as a nested regional climate model to dynamically downscale output from the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR's) Community Climate System Model (CCSM) version 3 and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-NCAR global reanalysis (NNRP). The latter is used for verification of late-twentieth-century climate simulations from the WRF. This analysis finds that the WRF is able to produce precipitation that is more realistic than that from its driving systems (the CCSM and NNRP). It also diagnoses potential issues with and differences between all of the simulations completed. Specifically, the magnitude of heavy 6-h average precipitation events, the frequency distribution, and the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the central United States are greatly improved. Projections from the WRF for late-twenty-first-century precipitation show decreases in average May August (MJJA) precipitation, but increases in the intensity of both heavy precipitation events and rain in general when it does fall. A decrease in the number of 6-h periods with rainfall accounts for the overall decrease in average precipitation. The WRF also shows an increase in the frequency of very heavy to extreme 6-h average events, but a decrease in the frequency of all events lighter than those over the central United States. Overall, projections from this study suggest an increase in the frequency of both floods and droughts during the warm season in the central United States."	0894-8755		APR 1	2011	24	7				1985	2002		10.1175/2010JCLI3447.1

An evaluation of uncertainties in monitoring middle atmosphere temperatures with the ground-based lidar network in support of space observations	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS									"The capability of the longest lidar data sets to monitor long-term temperature changes have been evaluated through comparisons with the successive Stratospheric Sounder Units (SSU) onboard NOAA satellites. Cross-consistency investigations between SSU and the lidar network can be considered as a first attempt to demonstrate how the synergistic use of space and ground-based instruments could provide reliable monitoring of the temperature of the middle atmosphere. The breakdown of the temperature cooling trend, and the following flattening observed in the satellite temperature series, is qualitatively confirmed by the lidars. However, there are still large differences that can either be due to SSU continuity (orbit drifts or weighting function modifications) or lidar operation changes (time of measurements, accuracy, sampling, etc.). SSU vertical weighting functions have been taken into account for comparisons. Some discontinuity events cannot be explained by the SSU weighting function drifts due to CO(2). For the upper channels of SSU (peaking around 50 km), the results are probably sensitive to the mesospheric part of the lidar profiles that can explain some discontinuities. Tropical lidar stations show clear inter-annual differences with the SSU channels covering the lowest altitude range that needs further investigations to understand if the origin is instrumental or geophysical. An attempt to derive non-linear trends with combinations of linear, hockey stick, and quadratic functions has been made. While the quadratic term is not highly significant, this approach allows the derivation of a better quantification of the linear trend terms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

MI coupling characteristics such as polar cap potential and field-aligned current (FAC), downward Poynting flux and vorticity of ionospheric convection are compared with observed statistical averages and with results from the Weimer 05 empirical model. The comparisons for eight different IMF clock-angle orientations show that the LFM model produces reasonably accurate average distributions of the Region land Region II currents. Both current systems have average amplitudes similar to those observed by the Iridium satellite constellation; however, the average LFM amplitudes are smaller by a factor of two compared with the values from the Weimer 05 model. The comparisons of polar cap potential show that the LFM model produces reasonable patterns of ionospheric convection, but the average cross polar cap potential (CPCP) is greater than the observed results by a factor of approximately 2 and greater than Weimer 05 by a factor of 1.5. The differences in convection in LFM results relative to the Weimer 05 model accounts for much of the difference in the Poynting flux patterns and integrated power produced by the two models. The comparisons of average ionospheric field-aligned vorticity show good agreement on the dayside; however, the LFM model gives higher nightside vorticity which may imply that the ionospheric conductance on the nightside is too small in the simulation.

Biophysical considerations in forestry for climate protection	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT									"Forestry - including afforestation (the planting of trees on land where they have not recently existed), reforesta tion, avoided deforestation, and forest management - can lead to increased sequestration of atmospheric carbor dioxide and has therefore been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change. However, forestry also influ ences land-surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmos phere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counter acting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate-change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways ir which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions, and highligh knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection.

In this paper, a statistical dynamical hurricane forecasting system, based on a statistical hurricane model, with explicit uncertainty estimates, and built from a suite of high-resolution global atmospheric dynamical model integrations spanning a broad range of climate states is described. The statistical model uses two climate predictors: the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical North Atlantic and SST averaged over the global tropics. The choice of predictors is motivated by physical considerations, as well as the results of high-resolution hurricane modeling and statistical modeling of the observed record. The statistical hurricane model is applied to a suite of initialized dynamical global climate model forecasts of SST to predict North Atlantic hurricane frequency, which peaks during the August October season, from different starting dates. Retrospective forecasts of the 1982-2009 period indicate that skillful predictions can be made from as early as November of the previous year; that is, skillful forecasts for the coming North Atlantic hurricane season could be made as the current one is closing. Based on forecasts initialized between November 2009 and March 2010, the model system predicts that the upcoming 2010 North Atlantic hurricane season will likely be more active than the 1982-2009 climatology, with the forecasts initialized in March 2010 predicting an expected hurricane count of eight and a 50% probability of counts between six (the 1966-2009 median) and nine."	0027-0644		APR	2011	139	4				1070	1082		10.1175/2010MWR3499.1

A series of sensitivity experiments was conducted to identify the primary differences between the two schemes that resulted in the large discrepancies in the simulations. Different approaches in treating graupel and hail were found to be responsible for many of the key differences between the baseline simulations. The inclusion of hail in the baseline simulation using the Milbrant- Yau scheme with two rimed-ice categories (graupel and hail) had little impact, and therefore resulted in a much different storm than the baseline run with the single-category (hail) Morrison scheme. With graupel as the choice of the single rimed-ice category, the simulated storms had considerably more frozen condensate in the anvil region, a weaker cold pool, and reduced surface precipitation compared to the runs with only hail, whose higher terminal fall velocity inhibited lofting. The cold pool strength was also found to be sensitive to the parameterization of raindrop breakup, particularly for the Morrison scheme, because of the effects on the drop size distributions and the corresponding evaporative cooling rates. The use of a more aggressive implicit treatment of drop breakup in the baseline Morrison scheme, by limiting the mean mass raindrop diameter to a maximum of 0.9 mm, opposed the tendency of this scheme to otherwise produce large mean drop sizes and a weaker cold pool compared to the hail-only run using the Milbrandt-Yau scheme."	0027-0644		APR	2011	139	4				1103	1130		10.1175/2010MWR3433.1

A space-time multiscale analysis system: A sequential variational analysis approach	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"As new observation systems are developed and deployed, new and presumably more precise information is becoming available for weather forecasting and climate monitoring. To take advantage of these new observations, it is desirable to have schemes to accurately retrieve the information before statistical analyses are performed so that statistical computation can be more effectively used where it is needed most. The authors propose a sequential variational approach that possesses advantages of both a standard statistical analysis [such as with a three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) or Kalman filter] and a traditional objective analysis (such as the Barnes analysis). The sequential variational analysis is multiscale, inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and temporally consistent, as shown by an idealized test case and observational datasets in this study. The real data cases include applications in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space and time for storm outflow boundary detection (surface application) and hurricane data assimilation (three-dimensional space application). Implemented using a multigrid technique, this sequential variational approach is a very efficient data assimilation method."	0027-0644		APR	2011	139	4				1224	1240		10.1175/2010MWR3338.1

Alternatively, one can receive such data from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, NC. Still, significant obstacles remain in order to unlock the full potential of the data. One set of obstacles is related to effective management of multi-terabyte datasets. A second set of obstacles, for hydrologists and hydrometeorologists in particular, is that the NEXRAD Level Ill products are not well suited for applications in hydrology. There is a strong need for the generation of high-quality products directly from the Level II data with well-documented steps that include quality control, removal of false echoes, rainfall estimation algorithms, coordinate conversion, georeferencing and integration with GIS. For hydrologists it is imperative that these procedures are basin-centered as opposed to radar-centered. The authors describe the Hydro-NEXRAD system that addresses the above challenges. With support from the National Science Foundation through its ITR program, the authors have developed a basin-centered framework for addressing all these issues in a comprehensive manner, tailored specifically for use of NEXRAD data in hydrology and hydrometeorology."	1464-7141		APR	2011	13	2				255	266		10.2166/hydro.2010.056

POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW									"Although integrated assessment models (IAM) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) consider population as one of the root causes of greenhouse gas emissions, how population dynamics affect climate change is still under debate. Population is rarely mentioned in policy debates on climate change. Studies in the past decade have added significantly to understanding the mechanisms and complexity of population and climate interactions. In addition to the growth of total population size, research shows that changes in population composition (i.e. age, urban-rural residence, and household structure) generate substantial effects on the climate system. Moreover, studies by the impact, vulnerability and adaptation (IAV) community also reveal that population dynamics are critical in the near term for building climate change resilience and within adaptation strategies. This paper explores how global population dynamics affect carbon emissions and climate systems, how recent demographic trends matter to worldwide efforts to adapt to climate change, and how population policies could make differences for climate change mitigation and adaptation."	0167-5923		APR	2011	30	2				287	312		10.1007/s11113-010-9189-7

The airborne environment constrained the design space to the simple optical layout that in-line non-beam-splitting holography affords. The desired measurement required the largest possible sample volume in which the smallest desired particle size (similar to 5 mu m) could still be resolved, and consequently the magnification requirement was driven by the pixel size of the camera and this particle size. The resulting design was a seven-element, double-telecentric, high-precision optical imaging system used to relay and magnify a hologram onto a CCD surface. The system was designed to preserve performance and high resolution over a wide temperature range. Details of the optical design and construction are given.

However, in the rapidly changing Arctic environment, the predictability characteristics of summer ice cover could undergo important transformations. Here global coupled climate model simulations are used to assess the inherent predictability of Arctic sea ice conditions on seasonal to interannual timescales within the Community Climate System Model, version 3. The role of preconditioning of the ice cover versus intrinsic variations in determining sea ice conditions is examined using ensemble experiments initialized in January with identical ice-ocean-terrestrial conditions. Assessing the divergence among the ensemble members reveals that sea ice area exhibits potential predictability during the first summer and for winter conditions after a year. The ice area exhibits little potential predictability during the spring transition season. Comparing experiments initialized with different mean ice conditions indicates that ice area in a thicker sea ice regime generally exhibits higher potential predictability for a longer period of time. In a thinner sea ice regime, winter ice conditions provide little ice area predictive capability after approximately 1 year. In all regimes, ice thickness has high potential predictability for at least 2 years."	0930-7575		APR	2011	36	7-8				1239	1253		10.1007/s00382-010-0792-4

Changes in Arctic clouds during intervals of rapid sea ice loss	CLIMATE DYNAMICS									"We investigate the behavior of clouds during rapid sea ice loss events (RILEs) in the Arctic, as simulated by multiple ensemble projections of the 21st century in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3). Trends in cloud properties and sea ice coverage during RILEs are compared with their secular trends between 2000 and 2049 during summer, autumn, and winter. The results suggest that clouds promote abrupt Arctic climate change during RILEs through increased (decreased) cloudiness in autumn (summer) relative to the changes over the first half of the 21st century. The trends in cloud characteristics (cloud amount, water content, and radiative forcing) during RILEs are most strongly and consistently an amplifying effect during autumn, the season in which RILEs account for the majority of the secular trends. The total cloud trends in every season are primarily due to low clouds, which show a more robust response than middle and high clouds across RILEs. Lead-lag correlations of monthly sea ice concentration and cloud cover during autumn reveal that the relationship between less ice and more clouds is enhanced during RILEs, but there is no evidence that either variable is leading the other. Given that Arctic cloud projections in CCSM3 are similar to those from other state-of-the-art GCMs and that observations show increased autumn cloudiness associated with the extreme 2007 and 2008 sea ice minima, this study suggests that the rapidly declining Arctic sea ice will be accentuated by changes in polar clouds."	0930-7575		APR	2011	36	7-8				1475	1489		10.1007/s00382-010-0816-0

It combined Thematic Mapper images and local-survey data to characterize plant functional types, and used observed emission potential of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from local plant species and high-resolution meteorological outputs from the MM5 model to constrain the MEGAN BVOC-emission model. The estimated annual emissions for isoprene, monoterpene and sesquiterpene are 95.55 x 106 kg C, 117.35 x 106 kg C and 9.77 x 106 kg C, respectively. The results show strong variabilities of terpenoid emissions spanning diurnal and seasonal time scales, which are mainly distributed in the remote areas (with more vegetation and less economic development) in PRD. Using MODIS PFTs data reduced terpenoid emissions by 27% in remote areas. Using MEGAN-model default emission factors led to a 24% increase in BVOC emission. The model errors of temperature and radiation in MM5 output were used to assess impacts of uncertainties in meteorological forcing on emissions: increasing (decreasing) temperature and downward shortwave radiation produces more (less) terpenoid emissions for July and January. Strong temporal variability of terpenoid emissions leads to enhanced ozone formation during midday in rural areas where the anthropogenic VOC emissions are limited."	0280-6509		APR	2011	63	2				241	254		10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00523.x

Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion(3). Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes(4). Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies(5). Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants(6) that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly similar to 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing similar to 100 to 300 seconds)."	0028-0836		MAR 31	2011	471	7340				608	611		10.1038/nature09935

"Entrainment and budgets of heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide in a convective boundary layer driven by time-varying forcing"	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"A large-eddy simulation (LES) code is coupled with a land surface model to investigate the diurnal variation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The diurnal evolution of the ABL is driven by a time-varying incoming solar radiation. The results show that the domain average surface fluxes of sensible heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide are smooth functions of time but the fluxes at any given surface grid point show random variations, especially the sensible heat flux. At the ABL top, the LES-resolved entrainment fluxes of these scalars also evolve with time and are not fixed fractions of their respective surface fluxes. Entrainment efficiency (the ratio of entrainment flux at z(i) to w(e)delta phi, where z(i) is the ABL height, w(e) is entrainment velocity, and delta phi is the jump of scalar across the entrainment zone) is highest for CO(2) and lowest for sensible heat. The first-order jump condition model is very good approximation to simulated entrainment fluxes which are largely controlled by the vertical gradients of the scalars across the capping inversion. Our results suggest that over the range of geostrophic winds considered (0-5 m s(-1)), neither the surface nor the entrainment flux reveals sensitivity to the geostrophic wind speed variations."	0148-0227		MAR 30	2011	116							D06308	10.1029/2010JD014938

Dust storm over the Black Rock Desert: Larger-scale dynamic signatures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"A dust storm that originated over the Black Rock Desert (BRD) of northwestern Nevada is investigated. Our primary goal is to more clearly understand the sequence of dynamical processes that generate surface winds responsible for entraining dust from this desert. In addition to reliance on conventional surface and upper-air observations, we make use of reanalysis data sets (NCAR/NCEP and NARR)-blends of primitive equation model forecasts and observations. From these data sets, we obtain the evolution of vertical motion patterns and ageostrophic motions associated with the event. In contrast to earlier studies that have emphasized the importance of indirect transverse circulations about an upper-level jet streak, our results indicate that in this case the transition from an indirect to a direct circulation pattern across the exit region of upper-level jet streak is central to creation of low-level winds that ablate dust from the desert. It is further argued that the transition of vertical circulation patterns is in response to adjustments to geostrophic imbalance-an adjustment time scale of 6-9 h. Although unproven, we suggest that antecedent rainfall over the alkali desert 2 weeks prior to the event was instrumental in lowering the bulk density of sediments and thereby improved the chances for dust ablation by the atmospheric disturbance. We comprehensively compare/contrast our results with those of earlier investigators, and we present an alternative view of key dynamical signatures in atmospheric flow that portend the likelihood of dust storms over the western United States."	0148-0227		MAR 29	2011	116							D06113	10.1029/2010JD014784

Dynamical and chemical characteristics of tropospheric intrusions observed during START08	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Intrusions of air from the tropical upper troposphere into the extratropical stratosphere above the subtropical jet potentially have a significant impact on the composition of the lowermost stratosphere (the stratospheric part of the ""middle world""). We present an analysis of tropospheric intrusion events observed during the Stratosphere-Troposphere Analyses of Regional Transport 2008 (START08) experiment using kinematic and chemical diagnostics. The transport processes operating during each event are discussed using high-resolution model analyses and backward trajectory calculations. Each intrusion observed during START08 can be related to a Rossby wavebreaking event over the Pacific Ocean. Trajectory analysis shows that the intruding air masses can be traced back to the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In situ chemical observations of the tropospheric intrusions are used to estimate the mixing time scales of the observed intrusions through use of a simple box model and trace species with different photochemical lifetimes. We estimate that the time scale for an intrusion to mix with the background stratospheric air is 5 to 6 days. Detailed analysis of small-scale features with tropospheric characteristics observed in the stratosphere suggests frequent irreversible transport associated with tropospheric intrusions. Trace gas distributions and correlations are consistent with the dynamics of the high-resolution NCEP GFS analyses, suggesting that these features are captured by the GFS assimilation and forecast system. A global analysis of intrusion events observed during the START08 time period (April-June 2008) is also given."	0148-0227		MAR 24	2011	116							D06111	10.1029/2010JD015098

Record of tropical interannual variability of temperature and water vapor from a combined AIRS-MLS data set	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We utilize a merged AIRS and MLS temperature and water vapor record (August 2004 to March 2010) to study the atmospheric variability of these quantities. The seasonal and spatial distribution of temperature and humidity shows the tropical western Pacific (TWP, 8 degrees S-8 degrees N, 120 degrees E-170 degrees E) to be a location with persistent deep convection and the tropical central Pacific (TCP, 8 degrees S-8 degrees N, 120 degrees W-170 degrees W) to be a region of subsidence, consistent with previous work. Furthermore, our estimates of 3.9 +/- 0.3 ppmv and 4.9 +/- 0.9 ppmv for the tropical mean stratospheric entry water vapor concentration and saturation mixing ratio, respectively, are well within previous estimates from a wide variety of observations. We also find that the interannual variability modes of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) both impact the tropopause region. The TWP (TCP) experiences enhancements (cancellation) of temperature anomalies when the ENSO and QBO are in phase. When these interannual modes fall out of phase the additive behavior of the anomalies migrate to the TCP with the TWP experiencing weaker anomalies. In both cases a change in the water vapor distribution is also observed. Our results are consistent with previous results, showing that this migration of anomaly enhancement and cancellation is a result of the ENSO impact on the Walker Circulation and the period when this occurs relative to the phase of the QBO. Our findings suggest that when the ENSO and QBO are out of phase, the TCP water vapor distribution may have a substantial impact on the tropical zonal water vapor distribution."	0148-0227		MAR 23	2011	116							D06103	10.1029/2010JD014841

It is well known that, in general, raw precipitation ensemble forecasts from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are not very reliable and that, for short-range prediction, human forecasters add significant skill to the NWP-generated single-valued quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF). In this paper, we describe and evaluate a statistical procedure for producing precipitation ensemble forecasts from single-valued QPFs. The procedure is based on the bivariate probability distribution between the observed precipitation and the single-valued QPF. The distribution is modeled as a mixed-type in which the relationship between the positive observed precipitation and positive forecast precipitation is assumed to be bivariate meta-Gaussian. We also describe and comparatively evaluate a generalized meta-Gaussian model in which the model parameter is optimized by minimizing the mean Continuous Ranked Probability Score. The performance of these procedures is assessed through dependent and cross validation using data for selected river basins in the service areas of the Arkansas-Red Basin, California-Nevada and Middle-Atlantic River Forecast Centers of the National Weather Service. The validation results show that, overall, the precipitation ensembles generated by the proposed procedures are reliable and capture the skill in the conditioning single-valued forecasts very well.

Transport pathways and signatures of mixing in the extratropical tropopause region derived from Lagrangian model simulations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Model simulations with the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) driven by wind fields of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were performed in the midlatitude tropopause region in April 2008 to study two research flights conducted during the START08 campaign. One flight targeted a deep tropospheric intrusion and another flight targeted a deep stratospheric intrusion event, both of them in the vicinity of the subtropical and polar jet. Air masses with strong signatures of mixing between stratospheric and tropospheric air masses were identified from measured CO-O(3) correlations, and the characteristics were reproduced by CLaMS model simulations. CLaMS simulations in turn complement the observations and provide a broader view of the mixed region in physical space. Using artificial tracers of air mass origin within CLaMS yields unique information about the transport pathways and their contribution to the composition in the mixed region from different transport origins. Three different regions are examined to categorize dominant transport processes: (1) on the cyclonic side of the polar jet within tropopause folds where air from the lowermost stratosphere and the cyclonic side of the jet is transported downward into the troposphere, (2) on the anticyclonic side of the polar jet around the 2 PVU surface air masses, where signatures of mixing between the troposphere and lowermost stratosphere were found with large contributions of air masses from low latitudes, and (3) in the lower stratosphere associated with a deep tropospheric intrusion originating in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL).

Organic aerosol formation downwind from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill	SCIENCE									"A large fraction of atmospheric aerosols are derived from organic compounds with various volatilities. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D research aircraft made airborne measurements of the gaseous and aerosol composition of air over the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that occurred from April to August 2010. A narrow plume of hydrocarbons was observed downwind of DWH that is attributed to the evaporation of fresh oil on the sea surface. A much wider plume with high concentrations of organic aerosol (>25 micrograms per cubic meter) was attributed to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from unmeasured, less volatile hydrocarbons that were emitted from a wider area around DWH. These observations provide direct and compelling evidence for the importance of formation of SOA from less volatile hydrocarbons."	0036-8075		MAR 11	2011	331	6022				1295	1299		10.1126/science.1200320

Ten years of CO emissions as seen from Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) retrievals are used as top-down constraints in an inversion for global CO emissions, for the past 10 years (from March 2000 to December 2009), at 8 day and 3.75 degrees x 2.75 degrees (longitude, latitude) resolution. The method updates a standard prior inventory and yields large increments in terms of annual regional budgets and seasonality. Our validation strategy consists in comparing our posterior-modeled concentrations with several sets of independent measurements: surface measurements, aircraft, and satellite. The posterior emissions, with a global 10 year average of 1430 TgCO/yr, are 37% higher than the prior ones, built from the EDGAR 3.2 and the GFEDv2 inventories (1038 TgCO/yr on average). In addition, they present some significant seasonal variations in the Northern Hemisphere that are not present in our prior nor in others' major inventories. Our results also exhibit some large interannual variability due to biomass burning emissions, climate, and socioeconomic factors; CO emissions range from 1504 TgCO (in 2007) to 1318 TgCO (in 2009)."	0148-0227		MAR 11	2011	116							D05304	10.1029/2010JD014416

Formaldehyde columns from the ozone monitoring instrument: Urban versus background levels and evaluation using aircraft data and a global model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We combine aircraft measurements (Second Texas Air Quality Study, Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations, Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment: Phase B) over the United States, Mexico, and the Pacific with a 3-D model (GEOS-Chem) to evaluate formaldehyde column (Omega(HCHO)) retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and assess the information they provide on HCHO across local to regional scales and urban to background regimes. OMI Omega(HCHO) correlates well with columns derived from aircraft measurements and GEOS-Chem (R = 0.80). For the full data ensemble, OMI's mean bias is -3% relative to aircraft-derived Omega(HCHO) (-17% where Omega(HCHO) > 5 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2)) and -8% relative to GEOS-Chem, within expected uncertainty for the retrieval. Some negative bias is expected for the satellite and model, given the plume sampling of many flights and averaging over the satellite and model footprints. Major axis regression for OMI versus aircraft and model columns yields slopes (95% confidence intervals) of 0.80 (0.62-1.03) and 0.98 (0.73-1.35), respectively, with no significant intercept. Aircraft measurements indicate that the normalized vertical HCHO distribution, required by the satellite retrieval, is well captured by GEOS-Chem, except near Mexico City. Using measured HCHO profiles in the retrieval algorithm does not improve satellite-aircraft agreement, suggesting that use of a global model to specify shape factors does not substantially degrade retrievals over polluted areas. While the OMI measurements show that biogenic volatile organic compounds dominate intra-annual and regional Omega(HCHO) variability across the United States, smaller anthropogenic Omega(HCHO) gradients are detectable at finer spatial scales (similar to 20-200 km) near many urban areas."	0148-0227		MAR 10	2011	116							D05303	10.1029/2010JD014870

The bubble model solves a set of concentration equations for multiple gases in bubbles of different sizes, and the dissolved gas concentration model simulates the evolution of dissolved gases and dissolved inorganic carbon. The models include the effects of advection, diffusion, bubble buoyant rising, bubble size changes, gas exchange between bubbles and ambient water, and chemical reactions associated with the dissolution of CO(2). The formulation consistency and the numerical accuracy are shown by the good agreement with a model describing individual bubble behavior in a test simulating the evolution of a bubble cloud released in the water. To study the bubble and dissolved gas evolution after a single wave-breaking event, the models are coupled with a fluid dynamical Direct Numerical Simulation model with spatially and temporally distributed momentum and bubble injection for a typical breaking wave. The modeled bubble size spectrum compares well with laboratory measurements. The breaker-induced vortex not only advects the bubble-induced dissolved gas anomalies downstream but also entrains the surface diffusion layer to greater depth. Due to the hydrostatic pressure and surface tension exerted on bubbles, gases inside bubbles are able to dissolve in slightly supersaturated water. When the water is highly supersaturated, bubbles add to the venting of dissolved gases."	0148-0227		MAR 8	2011	116							C03015	10.1029/2010JC006579

Rapid recovery of thermosphere density during the October 2003 geomagnetic storms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS									"Thermosphere densities from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites are utilized, for the first time, to study the recovery of the thermosphere as a function of latitude during the October 2003 storms. Our results show that the relaxation times, defined by the e-folding time of the poststorm recovery of thermosphere density, are about 6 and 8 h for two recovery phases of the October 2003 superstorms, respectively. Geomagnetic activity index Kp or ring current index Dst is incapable of describing the rapid recovery of thermosphere density. Moreover, a weak altitudinal dependence of the relaxation times was observed between the CHAMP and GRACE altitudes at middle and high latitudes, but no coherent latitudinal dependence was found. The MSISE00 and TIEGCM neutral densities are compared with the observations to assess their capability in predicting the thermosphere response during the recovery phase of extremely severe storms. Neither the MSISE00 nor the TIEGCM reproduced the rapid recovery of thermosphere densities seen in the CHAMP and GRACE, although the TIEGCM captured most of the salient features observed by CHAMP and GRACE when AMIE convection and precipitation patterns were used to specify the high-latitude drivers. The relaxation times of the MSISE00 and TIEGCM nighttime densities at 390 km are generally longer than those from the CHAMP observations by about 4 h, and even longer in the geographic latitudinal range of 25 degrees N-50 degrees N. The TIEGCM recovery times of thermosphere density are shorter on the dayside than on the nightside, whereas the MSISE00 densities show substantially longer relaxation times at low latitudes. Thus, not only are the relaxation times of the MSISE00 and TIEGCM densities longer than observed in the CHAMP and GRACE data, but they also show much larger day-night differences. No clear explanation can be found to fully understand the causes for the slower recovery of the thermosphere density simulated by the TIEGCM."	0148-0227		MAR 5	2011	116							A03306	10.1029/2010JA016164

Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Ice sheet mass balance estimates have improved substantially in recent years using a variety of techniques, over different time periods, and at various levels of spatial detail. Considerable disparity remains between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates, and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 +/- 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 +/- 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 +/- 1 Gt/yr(2) for Greenland and 14.5 +/- 2 Gt/yr(2) for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 +/- 2 Gt/yr(2). This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 +/- 6 Gt/yr(2)). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century. Citation: Rignot, E., I. Velicogna, M. R. van den Broeke, A. Monaghan, and J.

Multimodel climate and variability of the stratosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"The stratospheric climate and variability from simulations of sixteen chemistry-climate models is evaluated. On average the polar night jet is well reproduced though its variability is less well reproduced with a large spread between models. Polar temperature biases are less than 5 K except in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) lower stratosphere in spring. The accumulated area of low temperatures responsible for polar stratospheric cloud formation is accurately reproduced for the Antarctic but underestimated for the Arctic. The shape and position of the polar vortex is well simulated, as is the tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. There is a wide model spread in the frequency of major sudden stratospheric warnings (SSWs), late biases in the breakup of the SH vortex, and a weak annual cycle in the zonal wind in the tropical upper stratosphere. Quantitatively, ""metrics"" indicate a wide spread in model performance for most diagnostics with systematic biases in many, and poorer performance in the SH than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Correlations were found in the SH between errors in the final warming, polar temperatures, the leading mode of variability, and jet strength, and in the NH between errors in polar temperatures, frequency of major SSWs, and jet strength. Models with a stronger QBO have stronger tropical upwelling and a colder NH vortex. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate a number of common and long-standing model problems, particularly related to the simulation of the SH and stratospheric variability."	0148-0227		MAR 3	2011	116							D05102	10.1029/2010JD014995

The surface-pressure signature of atmospheric tides in modern climate models	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES									"Although atmospheric tides driven by solar heating are readily detectable at the earth's surface as variations in air pressure, their simulations in current coupled global climate models have not been fully examined. This work examines near-surface-pressure tides in climate models that contributed to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); it compares them with tides both from observations and from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which extends from the earth's surface to the thermosphere. Surprising consistency is found among observations and all model simulations, despite variation of the altitudes of model upper boundaries from 32 to 76 km in the IPCC models and at 135 km for WACCM. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that placing a model's upper boundary at low altitude leads to partly compensating errors such as reducing the forcing of the tides by ozone heating, but also introducing spurious waves at the upper boundary, which propagate to the surface."	0022-4928		MAR	2011	68	3				495	514		10.1175/2010JAS3560.1

A multimodel study of parametric uncertainty in predictions of climate response to rising greenhouse gas concentrations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"One tool for studying uncertainties in simulations of future climate is to consider ensembles of general circulation models where parameterizations have been sampled within their physical range of plausibility. This study is about simulations from two such ensembles: a subset of the climateprediction.net ensemble using the Met Office Hadley Centre Atmosphere Model, version 3.0 and the new ""CAMcube"" ensemble using the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3.5. The study determines that the distribution of climate sensitivity in the two ensembles is very different: the climateprediction.net ensemble subset range is 1.7-9.9 K, while the CAMcube ensemble range is 2.2-3.2 K. On a regional level, however, both ensembles show a similarly diverse range in their mean climatology. Model radiative flux changes suggest that the major difference between the ranges of climate sensitivity in the two ensembles lies in their clear-sky longwave responses. Large clear-sky feedbacks present only in the climateprediction.net ensemble are found to be proportional to significant biases in upper-tropospheric water vapor concentrations, which are not observed in the CAMcube ensemble. Both ensembles have a similar range of shortwave cloud feedback, making it unlikely that they are causing the larger climate sensitivities in climateprediction.net. In both cases, increased negative shortwave cloud feedbacks at high latitudes are generally compensated by increased positive feedbacks at lower latitudes."	0894-8755		MAR 1	2011	24	5				1362	1377		10.1175/2010JCLI3498.1

Parameterization of riming intensity and its impact on ice fall speed using ARM data	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Riming within mixed-phase clouds can have a large impact on the prediction of clouds and precipitation within weather and climate models. The increase of ice particle fall speed due to riming has not been considered in most general circulation models (GCMs), and many weather models only consider ice particles that are either unrimed or heavily rimed (not a continuum of riming amount). Using the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program dataset at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site of the United States, a new parameterization for riming is derived, which includes a diagnosed rimed mass fraction and its impact on the ice particle fall speed. When evaluated against a vertical-pointing Doppler radar for stratiform mixed-phase clouds, the new parameterization produces better ice fall speeds than a conventional parameterization. The new parameterization is tested in the recently developed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric model (AM3) using prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Compared with the standard (CTL) simulation, the new parameterization increases ice amount aloft by similar to 20%-30% globally, which reduces the global mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by similar to 2.8 W m(-2) and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave absorption by similar to 1.5 W m(-2). Global mean precipitation is also slightly reduced, especially over the tropics. Overall, the new parameterization produces a comparable climatology with the CTL simulation and it improves the physical basis for using a fall velocity larger than a conventional parameterization in the current AM3."	0027-0644		MAR	2011	139	3				1036	1047		10.1175/2010MWR3299.1

GPS RO refractivity is typically modeled at the ray perigee point by a ""local refractivity operator"" in a data assimilation system. Such modeling does not take into account the horizontal gradients that affect the UPS RO refractivity. A new observable (linear excess phase), defined as an integral of the refractivity along some fixed ray path within the model domain, has been developed in earlier studies to account for the effect of horizontal gradients. In this study, the error statistics of both observables (refractivity and linear excess phase) are estimated using the GPS RO data from the Formosa Satellite 3-Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) mission. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) method, which is based on lagged forecast differences, is applied for evaluation of the model forecast errors that are used for estimation of the UPS RO observational errors. Also used are Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model forecasts in the East Asia region at 45-km resolution for one winter month (mid-January to mid-February) and one summer month (mid-August to mid-September) in 2007. Fractional standard deviations of the observational errors of refractivity and linear excess phase both show an approximately linear decrease with height in the troposphere and a slight increase above the tropopause; their maximum magnitude is about 2.2% (2.5%) for refractivity and 1.1% (1.3%) for linear excess phase in the lowest 2 km for the winter (summer) month. An increase of both fractional observational errors near the surface in the summer month is attributed mainly to a larger amount of water vapor. The results indicate that the fractional observational error of refractivity is about twice as large as that of linear excess phase, regardless of season. The observational errors of both linear excess phase and refractivity are much less latitude dependent for summer than for winter. This difference is attributed to larger latitudinal variations of the specific humidity in winter."	0027-0644		MAR	2011	139	3				853	865		10.1175/2010MWR3260.1

The budget components behave differently in the shelf regime, inshore of the 200-m isobath, and the slope-interior regime, between the 200-m isobath and a fixed longitude (126 W) that is roughly 150 km offshore. The first of the three budget components is an estimate of the uncertainty in the ocean state given only a known history of wind stress forcing, with errors in the wind forcing estimated from differences between operational analyses. It is found that, over the continental shelf, the response to wind forcing is sufficiently strong and deterministic that significant skill in estimating shelf circulation can be achieved with knowledge only of the wind forcing, and no ocean data, for wind fields with these estimated errors. The second involves initial condition error and its influence on uncertainty, including both error growth with time from well-known initial conditions and error decay with time from poorly known initial conditions but with well-known wind forcing. The third component is that of boundary condition error and its influence on the interior solutions, including the dependence of that influence on the specific location along the boundary of the boundary condition error. Boundary condition errors with amplitude comparable to the root-mean-square variability at the boundary lead eventually to errors equal to the root-mean-square variability in the slope-interior regime, and somewhat smaller errors in the shelf regime. Covariance estimates based on differences of the wind-forced solutions from the ensemble mean are not dramatically different from those based on the full fields, and do not show strong state dependence."	0027-0644		MAR	2011	139	3				866	884		10.1175/2010MWR3352.1

MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"This paper explores the degree to which short-term forecasts with global models might be improved if clouds were fully included in a data assimilation system, so that observations of clouds affected all parts of the model state and cloud variables were adjusted during assimilation. The question is examined using a single ensemble data assimilation system coupled to two present-generation climate models with different treatments of clouds. ""Perfect-model"" experiments using synthetic observations, taken from a free run of the model used in subsequent assimilations, are used to circumvent complications associated with systematic model,errors and observational challenges; these provide a rough upper bound on the utility of cloud observations with these models. A series of experiments is performed in which direct observations of the model's cloud variables are added to the suite of observations being assimilated. In both models, observations of clouds reduce the 6-h forecast error, with much greater reductions in one model than in the other. Improvements are largest in regions where other observations are sparse. The two cloud schemes differ in their complexity and number of degrees of freedom; the model using the simpler scheme makes better use of the cloud observations because of the stronger correlations between cloud-related and dynamical variables (particularly temperature). This implies that the impact of real cloud observations will depend on both the strength of the instantaneous, linear relationships between clouds and other fields in the natural world, and how well each assimilating model's cloud scheme represents those relationships."	0027-0644		MAR	2011	139	3				946	957		10.1175/2010MWR3412.1

There was a strong seasonal dependence of the longitudinal variations of the aurora: (1) During solstices and for both hemispheres, auroral precipitation peaked between magnetic longitude (MLON) 210 degrees E and 360 degrees E in June and between MLON 120 degrees E and 300 degrees E in December. (2) In the equinoxes, the auroral longitudinal pattern was generally similar to that in local summer in each hemisphere, except that in the Northern Hemisphere the maximum precipitation was usually located in more westward longitudes in equinox than in summer. (3) The ratios between the maximum and the minimum of the precipitation energy flux along longitudes varied between 1.3 and 1.9, which were similar to those in previous studies. These features of the auroral longitudinal patterns did not change much from Kp = 1 to Kp = 4 conditions. Since the longitudinal distribution of auroral precipitation changed greatly with season in each hemisphere, the longitudinal variations of the magnetic field strength, which do not change with season, might not be the only process that caused the observed longitudinal variations of the aurora. Further data analysis shows that there was a significant negative correlation (coefficient vertical bar r vertical bar = similar to 0.4-0.8) between the peak auroral precipitation intensity and the solar-EUV-produced ionospheric conductivity of the same hemisphere (in summer and equinox) or of the conjugate hemisphere (in winter). These results indicate the important effects of solar-EUV-produced ionospheric conductivity, which has significant longitudinal variations, on the longitudinal patterns of the aurora at magnetic nighttime. Our results also suggest that the interhemispheric coupling during solstices might be an important factor that contributes to the longitudinal variations of the nighttime aurora. Our correlation analysis indicates that the hemispheric differences in the conjugate magnetic field strengths also contribute to the longitudinal variations of the aurora, although they appear not to be a major factor."	0148-0227		MAR 1	2011	116							A03302	10.1029/2010JA016051

Asteroseismic modelling of the solar-type subgiant star beta Hydri	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS									"Comparing models and data of pulsating stars is a powerful way to understand the stellar structure better. Moreover, such comparisons are necessary to make improvements to the physics of the stellar models, since they do not yet perfectly represent either the interior or especially the surface layers of stars. Because beta Hydri is an evolved solar-type pulsator with mixed modes in its frequency spectrum, it is very interesting for asteroseismic studies. Aims. The goal of the present work is to search for a representative model of the solar-type star beta Hydri, based on up-to-date non-seismic and seismic data. Methods. We present a revised list of frequencies for 33 modes, which we produced by analysing the power spectrum of the published observations again using a new weighting scheme that minimises the daily sidelobes. We ran several grids of evolutionary models with different input parameters and different physics, using the stellar evolutionary code ASTEC. For the models that are inside the observed error box of beta Hydri, we computed their frequencies with the pulsation code ADIPLS. We used two approaches to find the model that oscillates with the frequencies that are closest to the observed frequencies of beta Hydri: (i) we assume that the best model is the one that reproduces the star's interior based on the radial oscillation frequencies alone, to which we have applied the correction for the near-surface effects; (ii) we assume that the best model is the one that produces the lowest value of the chi-square (chi(2)), i. e. that minimises the difference between the observed frequencies of all available modes and the model predictions, after all model frequencies are corrected for near-surface effects. Results. We show that after applying a correction for near-surface effects to the frequencies of the best models, we can reproduce the observed modes well, including those that have mixed mode character. The model that gives the lowest value of the chi(2) is a post-main-sequence model with a mass of 1.04 M(circle dot) and a metallicity slightly lower than that of the Sun. Our results underscore the importance of having individual frequencies to constrain the properties of the stellar model."	0004-6361		MAR	2011	527							A37	10.1051/0004-6361/201015370

Radiative forcing and albedo feedback from the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere between 1979 and 2008	NATURE GEOSCIENCE									"The extent of snow cover(1) and sea ice(2) in the Northern Hemisphere has declined since 1979, coincident with hemispheric warming and indicative of a positive feedback of surface reflectivity on climate. This albedo feedback of snow on land has been quantified from observations at seasonal timescales(3-6), and century-scale feedback has been assessed using climate models(7-10). However, the total impact of the cryosphere on radiative forcing and albedo feedback has yet to be determined from measurements. Here we assess the influence of the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere on Earth's radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere-termed cryosphere radiative forcing-by synthesizing a variety of remote sensing and field measurements. We estimate mean Northern Hemisphere forcing at -4.6 to -2.2 W m(-2), with a peak in May of -9.0 +/- 2.7 W m(-2). We find that cyrospheric cooling declined by 0.45 W m(-2) from 1979 to 2008, with nearly equal contributions from changes in land snow cover and sea ice. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the albedo feedback from the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere falls between 0.3 and 1 : 1 W m(-2) K(-1), substantially larger than comparable estimates obtained from 18 climate models."	1752-0894		MAR	2011	4	3				151	155		10.1038/ngeo1062

The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: (1) a 152 +/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454964.57375(-0.00082)(+0.00060) + N * 0.837495(-0.000005)(+0.000004) days and (2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting 6.86 +/- 0.07 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454971.6761(-0.0023)(+0.0020) + N * 45.29485(-0.00076)(+0.00065) days. Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for > 4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties. Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5 Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like main-sequence star with T(eff) = 5627 +/- 44 K, M(star) = 0.895 +/- 0.060M(circle dot), and R(star) = 1.056 +/- 0.021R(circle dot). Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition: M(P) = 4.56(-1.29)(+1.17) M(circle plus), R(P) = 1.416(-0.036)(+0.033) R(circle plus), and rho P = 8.8(-2.9)(+2.1) g cm(-3).

Penumbral fine structure and driving mechanism of large-scale flows in simulated sunspots	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"We analyze in detail the penumbral structure found in a recent radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. Near tau = 1, the simulation produces penumbral fine structure consistent with the observationally inferred interlocking comb structure. Fast outflows exceeding 8 km s(-1) are present along almost horizontal stretches of the magnetic field; in the outer half of the penumbra, we see opposite polarity flux indicating flux returning beneath the surface. The bulk of the penumbral brightness is maintained by small-scale motions turning over on scales shorter than the length of a typical penumbral filament. The resulting vertical rms velocity at tau = 1 is about half of that found in the quiet Sun. Radial outflows in the sunspot penumbra have two components. In the uppermost few 100 km, fast outflows are driven primarily through the horizontal component of the Lorentz force, which is confined to narrow boundary layers beneath tau = 1, while the contribution from horizontal pressure gradients is reduced in comparison to granulation as a consequence of anisotropy. The resulting Evershed flow reaches its peak velocity near tau = 1 and falls off rapidly with height. Outflows present in deeper layers result primarily from a preferred ring-like alignment of convection cells surrounding the sunspot. These flows reach amplitudes of about 50% of the convective rms velocity rather independent of depth. A preference for the outflow results from a combination of Lorentz force and pressure driving. While the Evershed flow dominates by velocity amplitude, most of the mass flux is present in deeper layers and likely related to a large-scale moat flow."	0004-637X		MAR 1	2011	729	1						5	10.1088/0004-637X/729/1/5

This solution executes the interpreter on the secure coprocessor while the code and data of the program reside in the larger memory of an associated untrusted host. This allows the coprocessor to utilize the host's memory without fear of tampering even by a hostile host. This approach has several advantages including ease of use, and the ability to provide tamper-resistance for any program that can be constructed using the language. The language approach enabled the development of two novel mechanisms for implementing tamper resistance. These mechanisms provide alternatives to pure Merkle hash trees.

The observations indicate a relative increase in hydrogen peroxide by approximately 50% since 1900, with most of the change since the early 1970s. Using two model simulations spanning 1850 to present, we show that the modeled relative change in annual-mean surface hydrogen peroxide parallels the equivalent signal from the ice core record. In addition, we show that this relative change can be explained by the relative changes in tropospheric ozone concentration and mostly in ozone photolysis rates (J(O(1)D)). The simulated signal is therefore intimately related to the changes in stratospheric ozone associated with increases in chlorofluorocarbons; this is further demonstrated using total ozone column observations and the associated observed change in ice-core hydrogen peroxide."	0094-8276		FEB 25	2011	38							L04810	10.1029/2010GL045992

Model integrations in the first ensemble are conducted with a complete set of forcings: greenhouse gas concentrations from the A1B scenario, SSTs from corresponding ocean-atmosphere coupled model integrations, and ozone starting with severe depletion over the South Pole and recovering by mid-century. The integrations in the second ensemble are very similar to the first, except that only the transient ozone forcing is specified, and all other forcings are kept at year 2000 levels. Specifying ozone recovery in isolation allows us to determine unambiguously how it impacts the atmospheric circulation. We find that, in DJF, most key indices of atmospheric circulation show significant trends in the second ensemble, due to the closing of the ozone hole. In the first ensemble, however, trends are found to be statistically insignificant for nearly all key circulation indices. This suggests that ozone recovery will result in a nearly complete cancellation (and possible reversal) of the atmospheric circulation effects associated with increasing greenhouse gases, in Southern Hemisphere summer, over the coming half century.

Geospace Evironment Modeling 2008-2009 Challenge: Ground magnetic field perturbations	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS									"Acquiring quantitative metrics-based knowledge about the performance of various space physics modeling approaches is central for the space weather community. Quantification of the performance helps the users of the modeling products to better understand the capabilities of the models and to choose the approach that best suits their specific needs. Further, metrics-based analyses are important for addressing the differences between various modeling approaches and for measuring and guiding the progress in the field. In this paper, the metrics-based results of the ground magnetic field perturbation part of the Geospace Environment Modeling 2008-2009 Challenge are reported. Predictions made by 14 different models, including an ensemble model, are compared to geomagnetic observatory recordings from 12 different northern hemispheric locations. Five different metrics are used to quantify the model performances for four storm events. It is shown that the ranking of the models is strongly dependent on the type of metric used to evaluate the model performance. None of the models rank near or at the top systematically for all used metrics. Consequently, one cannot pick the absolute ""winner"": the choice for the best model depends on the characteristics of the signal one is interested in. Model performances vary also from event to event. This is particularly clear for root-mean-square difference and utility metric-based analyses. Further, analyses indicate that for some of the models, increasing the global magnetohydrodynamic model spatial resolution and the inclusion of the ring current dynamics improve the models' capability to generate more realistic ground magnetic field fluctuations."	1542-7390		FEB 24	2011	9							S02004	10.1029/2010SW000600

"Chromospheric jet and growing ""loop"" observed by H+E386inode: New evidence of fan-spine magnetic topology resulting from flux emergence"	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL									"We present observations of a chromospheric jet and growing ""loop"" system that show new evidence of a fan-spine topology resulting from magnetic flux emergence. This event, occurring in an equatorial coronal hole on 2007 February 9, was observed by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope in the Ca II H line in unprecedented detail. The predecessor of the jet is a bundle of fine material threads that extend above the chromosphere and appear to rotate about the bundle axis at similar to 50 km s(-1) (period less than or similar to 200 s). These rotations or transverse oscillations propagate upward at velocities up to 786 km s(-1). The bundle first slowly and then rapidly swings up, with the transition occurring at the onset of an A4.9 flare. A loop expands simultaneously in these two phases (velocity: 16-135 km s(-1)). Near the peak of the flare, the loop appears to rupture; simultaneous upward ejecta and mass downflows faster than free-fall appear in one of the loop legs. The material bundle then swings back in a whip-like manner and develops into a collimated jet, which is orientated along the inferred open-field lines with transverse oscillations continuing at slower rates. Some material falls back along smooth streamlines, showing no more oscillations. At low altitudes, the streamlines bifurcate at presumably a magnetic null point and bypass an inferred dome, depicting an inverted-Y geometry. These streamlines closely match in space the late Ca II H loop and X-ray flare loop. These observations are consistent with the model that flux emergence in an open-field region leads to magnetic reconnection, forming a jet and fan-spine topology. We propose that the material bundle and collimated jet represent the outer spine in quasi-static and eruptive stages, respectively, and the growing loop is a two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional fan surface."	0004-637X		FEB 20	2011	728	2						103	10.1088/0004-637X/728/2/103

This method is fully two-dimensional so that it may be easily implemented on non-cartesian grids such as the cubed-sphere grid. We present a flux-form implementation, FF-CSLAM, which retains the advantages of CSLAM while also allowing the use of flux-limited monotonicity and positivity preservation and efficient tracer sub-cycling. The methods are equivalent in the absence of flux limiting or reconstruction filtering. FF-CSLAM was found to be third-order accurate when an appropriately smooth initial mass distribution and flow field (with at least a continuous second derivative) was used. This was true even when using highly deformational flows and when the distribution is advected over the singularities in the cubed sphere, the latter a consequence of the full two-dimensionality of the method. Flux-limited monotonicity preservation, which is only available in a flux-form method, was found to be both less diffusive and more efficient than the monotone reconstruction filtering available to CSLAM. Despite the additional overhead of computing fluxes compared to CSLAM's cell integrations, the non-monotone FF-CSLAM was found to be at most only 40% slower than CSLAM for Courant numbers less than one, with greater overhead for successively larger Courant numbers.

Spatial statistics of likely convective clouds in CloudSat data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Spatial characteristics of cloud objects derived from 14 months of CloudSat data are analyzed with the aim of understanding global statistics for atmospheric convection. This study uses meteorological fields provided by NASA's Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and the European Center's ERA-Interim reanalysis to determine environmental conditions for the cloud objects. Width and aspect ratio statistics for clouds of likely convective origin are presented. Cloud object heights are compared with predictions from entraining plume models. A major finding of this study is that actual cloud depths are usually more than 50% smaller than those predicted by the plume models. This holds for a range of entrainment rate specifications, including rates based on observed cloud widths. A technique for isolating ""mature"" convective clouds based on their shape is proposed. When this technique is used to select objects, the comparison with the entraining plume model improves dramatically. Another result from this analysis is power law behavior in the cloud width distribution derived from CloudSat objects. After accounting for the difference between one-dimensional and two-dimensional sampling, the slope of the CloudSat distribution appears consistent with that found in earlier studies' cloud imagery. However, when clouds are selected using a minimum depth criterion, the resulting population is sharply peaked at widths close to this minimum depth.

Two new results are obtained in this study. First, the response of the mean radius of the satellite orbit per revolution (MRPR) to the oscillations in the mean atmospheric density per revolution (MDPR) increased linearly with oscillation periods. Therefore, MRPR had a strong oscillation near the 27 day period. However, it had no obvious 7, 9, and 13.5 day oscillations, although there were strong oscillations at the same periods in MDPR. Second, there was a phase difference of pi/2 between the oscillations of MRPR and MDPR. The phases of the oscillations in MRPR led the phases of the variations in MDPR. The correlation coefficient between the 27 day oscillations in MRPR and those in MDPR was 0.83 with a phase difference of -6.8 days for CHAMP; the correlation for GRACE was 0.67 with a phase difference of -6.4 days. The amplitudes of the oscillations in MRPR of CHAMP were larger than those of GRACE because GRACE had a higher orbit than CHAMP. These features are in good agreement with our theoretical analysis."	0148-0227		FEB 17	2011	116							A02315	10.1029/2010JA015995

This study examines how bioenergy and marketed environmental rents for forestland potentially influence land use in the Midwestern US. We hypothesize that current land uses reflect market values for environmental benefits of forestland, so that the marketed component of the environmental value of land can be captured as the difference between Census land values and value of land as a timber asset. We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the land use shares of forests, crops and urban in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The results show that marketed environmental rents increase forestland relative to cropland. To examine the effects of biofuels on land use, we conduct policy analysis by altering future land rents. Our baseline scenario projects that urban development uses mostly cropland, but with higher crop rents resulting from increased demand for bioenergy, there will be significant losses of forestland to urban and cropland. On the other hand, if marketed environmental rents grow while crop rents are maintained at their baseline value, urban growth will occur, primarily at the expense of cropland. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

New statistical methods for estimating the climate sensitivity have been proposed and provide a better quantification of relative probabilities of climate sensitivity within the almost canonical range of 2-4.5 K; however, large uncertainties remain, in particular for the upper bound. Simple indices of spatial radiation patterns are used here to establish a relationship between an observable radiative quantity and the equilibrium climate sensitivity. The indices are computed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multimodel dataset and offer a possibility to constrain climate sensitivity by considering radiation patterns in the climate system. High correlations between the indices and climate sensitivity are found, for example, in the cloud radiative forcing of the incoming longwave surface radiation and in the clear-sky component of the incoming surface shortwave flux, the net shortwave surface budget, and the atmospheric shortwave attenuation variable beta. The climate sensitivity was estimated from the mean of the indices during the years 1990-99 for the CMIP3 models. The surface radiative flux dataset from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) together with its top-of-atmosphere Energy Balanced and Filled equivalent (CERES EBAF) are used as a reference observational dataset, resulting in a best estimate for climate sensitivity of 3.3 K with a likely range of 2.7-4.0 K. A comparison with other satellite and reanalysis datasets show similar likely ranges and best estimates of 1.7-3.8 (3.3 K) [Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)], 2.9-3.7 (3.3 K) [International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project radiative surface flux data (ISCCP-FD)], 2.8-4.1 (3.5 K) [NASA's Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA)], 3.0-4.2 (3.6 K) [Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA-25)], 2.7-3.9 (3.4 K) [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim)], 3.0-4.0 (3.5 K) [ERA-40], and 3.1-4.7 (3.6 K) for the NCEP reanalysis. For each individual reference dataset. the results suggest that values for the sensitivity below 1.7 K are not likely to be consistent with observed radiation patterns given the structure of current climate models. For the aggregation of the reference datasets, the climate sensitivity is not likely to be below 2.9 K within the framework of this study, whereas values exceeding 4.5 K cannot be excluded from this analysis. While these ranges cannot be interpreted properly in terms of probability, they are consistent with other estimates of climate sensitivity and reaffirm that the current climatology provides a strong constraint on the lower bound of climate sensitivity even in a set of structurally different models."	0894-8755		FEB 15	2011	24	4				1034	1052		10.1175/2010JCLI3403.1

A new approach to homogenize daily radiosonde humidity data	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"Radiosonde humidity records represent the only in situ observations of tropospheric water vapor content with multi-decadal length and quasi-global coverage. However, their use has been hampered by ubiquitous and large discontinuities resulting from changes to instrumentation and observing practices. Here a new approach is developed to homogenize historical records of tropospheric (up to 100 hPa) dewpoint depression (DPD), the archived radiosonde humidity parameter. Two statistical tests are used to detect changepoints, which are most apparent in histograms and occurrence frequencies of the daily DPD: a variant of the Kolmogorov Smirnov (K-S) test for changes in distributions and the penalized maximal F test (PMFred) for mean shifts in the occurrence frequency for different bins of DPD. These tests capture most of the apparent discontinuities in the daily DPD data, with an average of 8.6 changepoints (similar to 1 changepoint per 5 yr) in each of the analyzed radiosonde records, which begin as early as the 1950s and ended in March 2009. Before applying breakpoint adjustments, artificial sampling effects are first adjusted by estimating missing DPD reports for cold (T < -30 degrees C) and dry (DPD artificially set to 30 degrees C) conditions using empirical relationships at each station between the anomalies of air temperature and vapor pressure derived from recent observations when DPD reports are available under these conditions. Next, the sampling-adjusted DPD is detrended separately for each of the 4-10 quantile categories and then adjusted using a quantile-matching algorithm so that the earlier segments have histograms comparable to that of the latest segment. Neither the changepoint detection nor the adjustment uses a reference series given the stability of the DPD series. Using this new approach, a homogenized global, twice-daily DPD dataset (available online at www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/) is created for climate and other applications based on the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) and two other data sources. The adjusted-daily DPD has much smaller and spatially more coherent trends during 1973-2008 than the raw data. It implies only small changes in relative humidity in the lower and middle troposphere. When combined with homogenized radiosonde temperature, other atmospheric humidity variables can be calculated, and these exhibit spatially more coherent trends than without the DPD homogenization. The DPD adjustment yields a different pattern of change in humidity parameters compared to the apparent trends from the raw data. The adjusted estimates show an increase in tropospheric water vapor globally."	0894-8755		FEB 15	2011	24	4				965	991		10.1175/2010JCLI3816.1

Hydrological field data from a modeller's perspective: Part 2: Process-based evaluation of model hypotheses	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES									"The current generation of hydrological models has been widely criticized for their inability to adequately simulate hydrological processes. In this study, we evaluate competing model representations of hydrological processes with respect to their capability to simulate observed processes in the Mahurangi River basin in Northland, New Zealand. In the first part of this two-part series, the precipitation, soil moisture, and flow data in the Mahurangi were used to estimate the dominant hydrological processes and explore several options for their suitable mathematical representation. In this paper, diagnostic tests are applied to gain several insights for model selection. The analysis highlights dominant hydrological processes (e. g. the importance of vertical drainage and baseflow compared to sub-surface stormflow), provides guidance for the choice of modelling approaches (e. g. implicitly representing sub-grid heterogeneity in soils), and helps infer appropriate values for model parameters. The approach used in this paper demonstrates the benefits of flexible model structures in the context of hypothesis testing, in particular, supporting a more systematic exploration of current ambiguities in hydrological process representation. The challenge for the hydrological community is to make better use of the available data, not only to estimate parameter values but also to diagnostically identify more scientifically defensible model structures.

The aim is to find boundary conditions which are physically suitable; that is, they let the waves move freely out of the domain and do not reflect them at the boundary in a nonphysical way (or a way that is believed to be nonphysical). Two types of boundary conditions, called linear and nonlinear, are proposed for two types of flows, namely subcritical and supercritical flows. The second aim in this article is to numerically implement these boundary conditions in a numerically effective way. This is achieved by a suitable extension of the central-upwind method for the spatial discretization and the Runge-Kutta method of second order for the time discretization. Several successful numerical experiments for which we tested the proposed boundary conditions and the numerical schemes are described.

Comparison between PLP observed and RO estimated orbit electron density on board CHAMP shows that RO estimation tends to overestimate the true orbit electron density by 10% averagely. The average relative deviation is similar to 20% and decreases slightly with the increase of the ionospheric peak height and the satellite orbit. It is larger at nighttime than daytime and peaks around sunrise time. Simulations based on COSMIC observations using NeQuick model indicate that the solar activity and the satellite orbit altitude variations will not influence the ratio of the successfully retrieved electron density profiles to the observed occultation events and the relative Abel inversion error of the electron density as well. Different orbit electron density derivation methods, including estimation by the RO total electron content, given by an independent on orbit observation, and assumed to be equal to the topmost point, will have no essential influence on the Abel retrieved electron density. Adding an on orbit observation even has a negative effect on the Abel retrieved electron density around the orbit altitude, which is contrary to our imagination."	0048-6604		FEB 11	2011	46							RS1013	10.1029/2010RS004514

Satellites measure recent rates of groundwater depletion in California's Central Valley	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"In highly-productive agricultural areas such as California's Central Valley, where groundwater often supplies the bulk of the water required for irrigation, quantifying rates of groundwater depletion remains a challenge owing to a lack of monitoring infrastructure and the absence of water use reporting requirements. Here we use 78 months (October, 2003-March, 2010) of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission to estimate water storage changes in California's Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins. We find that the basins are losing water at a rate of 31.0 +/- 2.7 mm yr(-1) equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 30.9 km(3) for the study period, or nearly the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States. We use additional observations and hydrological model information to determine that the majority of these losses are due to groundwater depletion in the Central Valley. Our results show that the Central Valley lost 20.4 +/- 3.9 mm yr(-1) of groundwater during the 78-month period, or 20.3 km(3) in volume. Continued groundwater depletion at this rate may well be unsustainable, with potentially dire consequences for the economic and food security of the United States. Citation: Famiglietti, J. S., M.

"Partitioning of semivolatile surface-active compounds between bulk, surface and gas phase"	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"We present a model study demonstrating that surface partitioning of volatile surfactants enhances their uptake by submicron liquid droplets. In submicron-sized droplets, surface partitioning of a surface-active volatile species may significantly decrease its equilibrium partial pressure, thus increasing the total flux of the surfactant from gas phase to aqueous phase. Such uptake of volatile organic species into aqueous aerosols can be followed by aqueous-phase chemistry to form low-volatility secondary organic aerosol material, leading to increased aerosol mass. In the study, we used an air parcel model that includes simplified aqueousand gas-phase chemistry, condensation/evaporation, and a model of aqueous-phase thermodynamics that takes into account the partitioning of surfactants between the bulk and surface phases. We modeled the uptake and aqueousphase chemical reactions of methylglyoxal, as it is a moderate surfactant that forms less volatile secondary organic material via aqueous-phase chemical reactions with the hydroxyl radical as well as hydronium and ammonium ions. Our model simulations show an order of magnitude higher uptake of methylglyoxal in aqueous aerosols of cloud condensation nuclei sizes (less than 200 nmin radius) when surface partitioning is taken into account, compared to when surface partitioning is neglected. As a consequence, the production of SOA through the aqueous-phase chemical processing of methylglyoxal is also enhanced, but to a lesser degree, because condensation of the hydroxyl radical from gas phase limits the production.

Radio occultation measurements from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites provide a new data source for study of the winter anomaly on a global scale. In this study we investigate the altitude, local time, latitude, longitude, and hemispheric variations of the electron density in the middle-latitude ionosphere by analyzing the COSMIC data measured in 2007 during a magnetically quiet period (Kp <= 3). The seasonal mean behavior of the NmF(2) obtained from COSMIC data shows the occurrence of the winter anomaly feature during 0800-1600 LT in the Northern Hemisphere but not in the Southern Hemisphere. The intensity of the winter anomaly is variable with longitude, and a more intense winter anomaly is likely to occur at longitudes closer to the magnetic pole. At northern middle latitudes, a greater electron density in the winter than in the summer occurs in the narrow altitude range near the F-peak height. Except for the winter anomaly feature at northern middle latitudes, the electron density at middle latitudes is greater during the summer than during the winter in both hemispheres."	0148-0227		FEB 4	2011	116							A02302	10.1029/2010JA015815

These two types of error often originate from different sources (e.g. rainfall-runoff modeling vs. routing) and hence may have different implications and ramifications for both model diagnosis and decision support. Thus, where possible and relevant, they should be distinguished and separated in model evaluation and forecast verification applications. Distinct information on timing errors in hydrologic prediction could lead to more targeted model improvements in a diagnostic evaluation context, as well as better-informed decisions in many practical applications, such as flood prediction, water supply forecasting, river regulation, navigation, and engineering design. However, information on timing errors in hydrologic predictions is rarely evaluated or provided. In this paper, we discuss the importance of assessing and quantifying timing error in hydrologic predictions and present a new approach, which is based on the cross wavelet transform (XWT) technique. The XWT technique transforms the time series of predictions and corresponding observations into a two-dimensional time-scale space and provides information on scale- and time-dependent timing differences between the two time series. The results for synthetic timing errors (both constant and time-varying) indicate that the XWT-based approach can estimate timing errors in streamflow predictions with reasonable reliability. The approach is then employed to analyze the timing errors in real streamflow simulations for a number of headwater basins in the US state of Texas. The resulting timing error estimates were consistent with the physiographic and climatic characteristics of these basins. A simple post-factum timing adjustment based on these estimates led to considerably improved agreement between streamflow observations and simulations, further illustrating the potential for using the XWT-based approach for timing error estimation.

ISDAC's primary aim was to examine the effects of aerosols, including those generated by Asian wildfires, on clouds that contain both liquid and ice. ISDAC utilized the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Pro-gram's permanent observational facilities at Barrow and specially deployed instruments measuring aerosol, ice fog, precipitation, and radiation. The National Research Council of Canada Convair-580 flew 27 sorties and collected data using an unprecedented 41 state-of-the-art cloud and aerosol instruments for more than 100 h on 12 different days. Aerosol compositions, including fresh and processed sea salt, biomass-burning particles, organics, and sulfates mixed with organics, varied between flights. Observations in a dense arctic haze on 19 April and above, within, and below the single-layer stratocumulus on 8 and 26 April are enabling a process-oriented understanding of how aerosols affect arctic clouds. Inhomogeneities in reflectivity, a close coupling of upward and downward Doppler motion, and a nearly constant ice profile in the single-layer stratocumulus suggests that vertical mixing is responsible for its longevity. observed during ISDAC. Data acquired in cirrus on flights between Barrow and Fairbanks, Alaska, are improving the understanding of the performance of cloud probes in ice. Ultimately, ISDAC data will improve the representation of cloud and aerosol processes in models covering a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and determine the extent to which surface measurements can provide retrievals of aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and radiative heating."	0003-0007		FEB	2011	92	2				183	+		10.1175/2010BAMS2935.1

It is found that 4DVar has consistently smaller error than that of 3DVar for winds and temperature at all forecast lead times except at 60 and 72 h when their forecast errors become comparable in amplitude, while the two schemes have similar performance in moisture at all lead times. The forecast error of the EnKF is comparable to that of the 4DVar at 12-36-h lead times, both of which are substantially smaller than that of the 3DVar, despite the fact that 3DVar fits the sounding observations much more closely at the analysis time.

Distant effects of a recurving tropical cyclone on rainfall in a midlatitude convective system: A high-impact rredecessor rain event	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"Recent research has identified predecessor rain events (PREs), which are mesoscale regions of heavy rainfall that occur similar to 1000 km poleward and downshear of recurving tropical cyclones (TCs). PREs typically occur 24-36 h prior to the arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC, and frequently result in damaging flooding. A distinguishing feature of a PRE is that it is enhanced by a broad region of deep tropical moisture directly associated with the TC that is transported well poleward ahead of the TC. This study will quantify the effects of the tropical moisture from one TC on a record-breaking rain and flood event over the northern Great Plains and southern Great Lakes region on 18-19 August 2007. In this event, which occurred ahead of TC Erin, a southerly stream of deep tropical moisture (precipitable water values > 50 mm) moved poleward and intersected a northwest-southeast-oriented quasi-stationary baroclinic zone beneath the equatorward entrance region of an upper-level jet streak. A slow-moving mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed and produced widespread heavy rainfall, with local amounts exceeding 380 mm that resulted in historic flooding in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Observations and numerical simulations using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF) indicate that low-level frontogenesis was maximized during the overnight hours of 19 August 2007 and provided the forcing for vigorous ascent during the mature stage of the PRE. A control simulation, which included the poleward transport of TC Erin-related moisture, reproduced the extreme rainfall amounts, although the simulated rainfall was displaced from where it was observed. A sensitivity simulation in which the moisture associated with TC Erin was removed (referred to as ""NOPLUME"") shows reduced convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the inflow region of the PRE and a less vigorous MCS. In all, there was an approximately 50% reduction in the maximum precipitation amount and a 25% reduction in the total precipitation from the control simulation to the NOPLUME run. Or, considered in the context of rainfall enhancement by the Erin-related moisture, there was a near doubling of the maximum amount and a 33% increase in the total rainfall. The extent of these differences underscores the importance of moisture originating from TC Erin in transforming a heavy rain event into a high-impact, record-breaking rain event."	0027-0644		FEB	2011	139	2				650	667		10.1175/2010MWR3453.1

The instrument consists of a heated thin disk that provides a reliable, low-maintenance method to measure precipitation rate every minute without the use of a wind shield. The disk consists of two heated, thermally isolated identical aluminum plates one facing upward and the other downward. The two plates are heated independently, and both are maintained at constant temperature above 75 degrees C by electronic circuitry that heats the plates depending on the deviation from the set temperature. Precipitation rate is estimated by calculating the power required to either melt or evaporate snow or to evaporate rain on the upward-facing plate, compensated for wind effects by subtracting out the power on the lower, downward-facing plate. Data from the World Meteorological Organization reference standard for liquid-equivalent snowfall rate measurements, the Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) shield system, were used as the truth to develop the hotplate algorithm. The hotplate measures the liquid-equivalent precipitation rate from 0.25 to 35 mm within the National Weather Service standard for solid precipitation measurement. The hotplate was also shown to measure wind speed during severe icing conditions and during vibration. The high update rate (precipitation rate, wind speed, and temperature every 1 min), make this an ideal gauge for real-time applications, such as aircraft deicing and road weather conditions. It serves as an accumulation gauge by integrating the 1-min rates over time. It can also be used as a rain gauge for rainfall rates up to 35 mm h(-1)."	0739-0572		FEB	2011	28	2				148	164		10.1175/2010JTECHA1375.1

Here results are presented using the next-generation NCAR GCM-the High-Order Methods Modeling Environment (HOMME)-as a dry dynamical core at a coarse resolution of about 167 km. coupled to a simple multicloud parameterization. The coupling is performed through a judicious choice of heating vertical profiles for the three cloud types-congestus, deep, and stratiform-that characterize organized tropical convection. Important control parameters that affect the types of waves that emerge are the background vertical gradient of the moisture and the stratiform fraction in the multicloud parameterization, which set the strength of large-scale moisture convergence and unsaturated downdrafts in the wake of deep convection, respectively. Three numerical simulations using different moisture gradients and different stratiform fractions are considered. The first experiment uses a large moisture gradient and a small stratiform fraction and provides an MJO-like example. It results in an intraseasonal oscillation of zonal wavenumber 2, moving eastward at a constant speed of roughly 5 m s(-1). The second uses a weaker background moisture gradient and a large stratiform fraction and yields convectively coupled Rossby, Kelvin, and two-day waves, embedded in and interacting with each other; and the third experiment combines the small stratiform fraction and the weak background moisture gradient to yield a planetary-scale (wavenumber 1) second baroclinic Kelvin wave. While the first two experiments provide two benchmark examples that reproduce several key features of the observational record, the third is more of a demonstration of a bad MJO model solution that exhibits very unrealistic features."	0022-4928		FEB	2011	68	2				240	264		10.1175/2010JAS3443.1

The Twomey approach relates the concentration of activated droplets to the maximum supersaturation experienced by the air parcel during activation and thus avoids complications of CCN size distribution and chemical composition that are considered in more complicated activation schemes. When using the traditional Twomey scheme, activated droplets are typically inserted into the first bin of the bin microphysics scheme. As shown in our previous study, this does not allow numerical convergence when the number of bins is increased. In addition, CCN characteristics are important for early growth of cloud droplets and it is unclear if an approach where such characteristics are not considered provides a valid strategy for modeling diffusional growth of small cloud droplets. We included relatively simple modifications to the bin warm-rain microphysics with Twomey approach to CCN activation and apply the improved scheme to idealized Lagrangian parcel simulations as well as 1D Eulerian updraft simulations. We compare results of the improved scheme with the benchmark results from a sophisticated aerosol activation and growth model. Two observationally-based aerosol characteristics are employed in the comparison, the pristine from DYCOMS and polluted from VOCALS. The results suggest that the improved bin scheme compares relatively well with the benchmark, and leads to numerical results that are significantly less sensitive to the number of bins applied. The results also suggest the minimum bin and spatial resolutions that need to be used in the large-eddy simulation to investigate with confidence the impact of cloud turbulence on warm-rain development.

Two maxima in globally averaged CO concentrations are identified: one in April and one in October, with two minima in July and December. These maxima and minima are attributable to the respective maxima and minima in CO concentrations over the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Over the Tropics, maximum and minimum CO concentrations are noted in October and June, respectively, due primarily to biomass burning. During El Nino DJF (December-January-February) and JJA (June-July-August), predominantly positive anomalies in CO total column are noted over the entire globe except for the high latitudes of both hemispheres and the central part of the South America where negative anomalies are identified. La Nina DJF and AA are largely opposite to El Nino DJF and JJA in CO total column anomalies. Negative (positive) anomalies in CO total column tend to be associated with wet (dry) anomalies in precipitation over the major polluted areas during ENSO. It is suggested that changes in the atmospheric circulations during ENSO either enhance or weaken precipitation systems with the associated precipitation modulating CO total column. The correspondence between anomalies in CO total column and anomalies in Terra MODIS fire pixels during ENSO is rather poor over many parts of the world. (C0 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Several reasons have been proposed for this rather surprising finding, but no firm conclusions have been drawn so far. Here we study several of the proposed reasons: Enhanced coagulational scavenging of sub-3 nm clusters at high RH, diminished solar radiation at high RH leading to diminished gas phase oxidation chemistry, and increased condensation sink (CS) of condensable gases due to hygroscopic growth of the preexisting particles. Our theoretical calculations indicate that the increase of coagulational scavenging plays a relatively small role in the inhibition of nucleation at high RH. On the other hand, field data show that the maximum observed gas phase sulphuric acid concentrations are limited to RHs below 60%. The field data also indicate that this is likely due to low OH concentrations at high RH. This finding is also supported by aerosol dynamics model simulations. The model was used to find out whether this is mainly due to decreased source (solar radiation) or increased sink (CS) terms at the elevated RH. The simulation results show that the decreased source term at high RH limits H(2)SO(4) levels in the air, and therefore high new particle formation rates (above similar to 1 cm(-3) s(-1)) rarely occur above 80% RH."	0148-0227		FEB 1	2011	116							D03202	10.1029/2010JD014186

These disturbances have historically been interpreted as being the signature of slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves propagating into the corona. The detailed analysis of Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) timeseries observations of an active region (known to contain propagating disturbances) shows strongly correlated, quasi-periodic, oscillations in intensity, Doppler shift, and line width. No frequency doubling is visible in the latter. The enhancements in the moments of the line profile are generally accompanied by a faint, quasi-periodically occurring, excess emission at similar to 100 km s(-1) in the blue wing of coronal emission lines. The correspondence of quasi-periodic excess wing emission and the moments of the line profile indicates that repetitive high-velocity upflows are responsible for the oscillatory behavior observed. Furthermore, we show that the same quasi-periodic upflows can be directly identified in a simultaneous image sequence obtained by the Hinode X-Ray Telescope. These results are consistent with the recent assertion of De Pontieu & McIntosh that the wave interpretation of the data is not unique. Indeed, given that several instances are seen to propagate along the direction of the EIS slit that clearly shows in-phase, quasi-periodic variations of intensity, velocity, width (without frequency doubling), and blue wing enhanced emission, this data set would appear to provide a compelling example that upflows are more likely to be the main cause of the quasi-periodicities observed here, as such correspondences are hard to reconcile in the wave paradigm."	2041-8205		FEB 1	2011	727	2						L37	10.1088/2041-8205/727/2/L37

Mesogranulation and the solar surface magnetic field distribution	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS									"The relation of the solar surface magnetic field with mesogranular cells is studied using high spatial (approximate to 100 km) and temporal (approximate to 30 s) resolution data obtained with the IMaX instrument on board SUNRISE. First, mesogranular cells are identified using Lagrange tracers (corks) based on horizontal velocity fields obtained through local correlation tracking. After approximate to 20 minutes of integration, the tracers delineate a sharp mesogranular network with lanes of width below about 280 km. The preferential location of magnetic elements in mesogranular cells is tested quantitatively. Roughly 85% of pixels with magnetic field higher than 100 G are located in the near neighborhood of mesogranular lanes. Magnetic flux is therefore concentrated in mesogranular lanes rather than intergranular ones. Second, magnetic field extrapolations are performed to obtain field lines anchored in the observed flux elements. This analysis, therefore, is independent of the horizontal flows determined in the first part. A probability density function (PDF) is calculated for the distribution of distances between the footpoints of individual magnetic field lines. The PDF has an exponential shape at scales between 1 and 10 Mm, with a constant characteristic decay distance, indicating the absence of preferred convection scales in the mesogranular range. Our results support the view that mesogranulation is not an intrinsic convective scale (in the sense that it is not a primary energy-injection scale of solar convection), but also give quantitative confirmation that, nevertheless, the magnetic elements are preferentially found along mesogranular lanes."	2041-8205		FEB 1	2011	727	2						L30	10.1088/2041-8205/727/2/L30

On the ability of the gas/particle partitioning constant K(p) to consider the effects of mean MW and the presence of high MW compounds	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"The advantages of the original form of the predictive expression for the gas/particle partition constant K(p) (m(3) mu g(-1)) are considered. The expression K(p,i) for compound i contains p(L,i)(o), zeta(i) and (MW) over bar. These are the pure-compound liquid vapor pressure, the mole-fraction-scale activity coefficient in the absorbing particulate matter (PM) phase, and the mean molecular weight (g mol(-1)) of the absorbing phase. Algorithms are available for predicting zeta(i) values in mixtures of organic compounds and water as they are affected by energetic and entropic effects: Flory-Huggins Theory provides a convenient way to examine the entropic effects of the presence of high MW compounds on the zeta(i) values of lower MW compounds. In the exposition of their volatility basis set (VBS) approach for modeling organic aerosol condensation. Donahue et al. (2006, Environ. Sci. Technol., 40, 2635-2643, Supplementary Material) argued that the need to consider (MW) over bar values can be avoided by switching from the mole fraction scale to a mass fraction scale and accompanying C(i)(*) values that incorporate mass-fraction-scale activity coefficient values zeta(i)'. In practice however, the VBS approach usually ignores both activity and (MW) over bar corrections by setting zeta(i)' = 1. (An equation for zeta(i)' is developed here in the event that modeling with zeta(i)' not equal 1 becomes of interest) Regardless of the advantages of the prediction equation for K(p,i) there will undoubtedly be circumstances when (MW) over bar and zeta(i) values become inaccessible, as for aged organic particulate matter in which a large mass fraction of the absorbing PM of is of indeterminable molecular nature. In such cases, ""prediction"" of K(p,i) values may only be possible by means of empirical correlation of log K(p,i) vs. log p(L,i)(o) for the PM type of interest. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of wave energy accumulation in tropical cyclogenesis over the tropical North Atlantic	CLIMATE DYNAMICS									"A hierarchical modeling approach is used to study the process by which interactions of easterly waves with the background flow can result in a reduction in the longitudinal and vertical scale of the waves. Theory suggests that in flows that possess a negative longitudinal gradient (U (x) < 0) there is a reduction of longitudinal and vertical group speeds and an increase in regional wave action density (or ""wave energy""). Relative vorticity increases locally leading to an increase in the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis near the wave axis. Opposite impacts on the structure of the waves is expected in a U (x) > 0 domain. In the simplified framework of a free-surface and divergent shallow water model, Rossby wave properties are tracked through a range of background flow scenarios to determine the important scales of interaction. The importance of wave energy accumulation for tropical cyclogenesis is then studied in a full physics and dynamics model using a nested regional climate model simulation, at 12 km horizontal grid spacing, over the tropical North Atlantic region for the entire 2005 hurricane season.

No individual model performs best for all fluxes. Providing additional information about the surface generally results in better performance. However, there is clear evidence that poor choice of parameter values can cause a large drop in performance for models that otherwise perform well.

Effects of surface heat and moisture exchange on ARW-WRF warm-season precipitation forecasts over the Central United States	WEATHER AND FORECASTING									"The evolution of the daytime planetary boundary layer (PBL) and its association with warm-season precipitation is strongly impacted by land atmosphere heat and moisture exchange (hereafter surface exchange). However, substantial uncertainty exists in the parameterization of the surface exchange in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In the current study, the authors examine 0-24-h convection-permitting forecasts with different surface exchange strengths for a 6-day period during the International H(2)O Project (IHOP_2002). Results indicate sensitivity in the timing of simulated afternoon convection initiation and subsequent precipitation amounts to variations in surface exchange strength. Convection initiation in simulations with weak surface exchange was delayed by 2-3 h compared to simulations with strong surface exchange, and area-averaged total precipitation amounts were less by up to a factor of 2. Over the western high plains (105 degrees-100 degrees W longitude), where deep convection is locally generated, simulations using a formulation for surface exchange that varied with the vegetation category (height) produced area-averaged diurnal cycles of forecasted precipitation amounts in better agreement with observations than simulations that used the current Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW-WRF) formulation. Parcel theory is used to diagnose mechanisms by which differences in surface exchange influence convection initiation in individual case studies. The more rapid initiation in simulations with strong surface exchange results from a more rapid removal of negative buoyancy beneath the level of free convection, which arises primarily from greater PBL warming."	0882-8156		FEB	2011	26	1				3	25		10.1175/2010WAF2222426.1

Significant diurnal variations were found in surface wind, temperature, and dewpoint temperature between days with and without afternoon thunderstorms (TS(A) and non-TS(A) days). Before thunderstorms occurred, on TS(A) days, the surface temperature was warmer (about 0.5 degrees-1.5 degrees C) and the surface dewpoint temperature was moister (about 0.5 degrees-2 degrees C) than on non-TS(A) days. Sounding observations from northern Taiwan also showed warmer and higher moisture conditions on TS(A) days relative to non-TS(A) days.

Atmospheric stability effects on wind fields and scalar mixing within and just above a subalpine forest in sloping terrain	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY									"Air temperature T (a) , specific humidity q, CO(2) mole fraction chi (c) , and three-dimensional winds were measured in mountainous terrain from five tall towers within a 1 km region encompassing a wide range of canopy densities. The measurements were sorted by a bulk Richardson number Ri (b) . For stable conditions, we found vertical scalar differences developed over a ""transition"" region between 0.05 < Ri (b) < 0.5. For strongly stable conditions (Ri (b) > 1), the vertical scalar differences reached a maximum and remained fairly constant with increasing stability. The relationships q and chi (c) have with Ri (b) are explained by considering their sources and sinks. For winds, the strong momentum absorption in the upper canopy allows the canopy sublayer to be influenced by pressure gradient forces and terrain effects that lead to complex subcanopy flow patterns. At the dense-canopy sites, soil respiration coupled with wind-sheltering resulted in CO(2) near the ground being 5-7 mu mol mol(-1) larger than aloft, even with strong above-canopy winds (near-neutral conditions). We found Ri (b) -binning to be a useful tool for evaluating vertical scalar mixing; however, additional information (e.g., pressure gradients, detailed vegetation/topography, etc.) is needed to fully explain the subcanopy wind patterns. Implications of our results for CO(2) advection over heterogenous, complex terrain are discussed."	0006-8314		FEB	2011	138	2				231	262		10.1007/s10546-010-9560-6

In this study, a photosynthesis-based Gas-exchange Evapotranspiration Model (GEM) is integrated into the Noah land-surface model replacing the traditional Jarvis scheme for estimating the canopy resistance and transpiration. Using 18-month simulations from the High Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS), the impact of the photosynthesis-based approach on the simulated canopy resistance, surface heat fluxes, soil moisture, and soil temperature over different vegetation types is evaluated using data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site, Oklahoma Mesonet, 2002 International H(2)O Project (IHOP_2002), and three Ameriflux sites. Incorporation of GEM into Noah improves the surface energy fluxes as well as the associated diurnal cycle of soil moisture and soil temperature during both wet and dry periods. An analysis of midday, average canopy resistance shows similar day-to-day trends in the model fields as seen in observed patterns. Bias and standard deviation analyses for soil temperature and surface fluxes show that GEM responds somewhat better than the Jarvis scheme, mainly because the Jarvis approach relies on a parametrised minimum canopy resistance and meteorological variables such as air temperature and incident radiation. The analyses suggest that adding a photosynthesis-based transpiration scheme such as GEM improves the ability of the land-data assimilation system to simulate evaporation and transpiration under a range of soil and vegetation conditions."	0006-8314		FEB	2011	138	2				263	284		10.1007/s10546-010-9559-z

The methodology is composed of four components. The first and second components are SSURGO and NLCD preprocessors. The third component is a parameter generator producing SAC-SMA parameters for each soil survey area on an approximately 30-m grid mesh. The last component is a postprocessor creating parameters for user-specified areas of interest on the Hydrologic Rainfall Analysis Project (HRAP) grid. Implemented in open-source software, this approach was employed by creating a set of SAC-SMA parameter and related soil property grids spanning 25 states, wherein it was shown to greatly reduce the derivation time and meanwhile yield results comparable to those based on the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO).

All available temperature-salinity (T-S) profiles from the Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program and Argo data are divided into two subsets; one half is used for producing the vertical coupled T-S empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes, and the other half is used for the verification. We employed a weighted least-squares method that minimizes the misfits between the predetermined EOF structures and independent observed temperature and altimetry data. Verification shows that the South Indian and North Atlantic oceans maintain good correlations to 900 m depth between the observed and reconstructed salinity with altimetry data. Meanwhile, the Pacific and Antarctic oceans below 500 m shows significant negative correlations which are associated with the relationship between steric height and salinity variability in these basins. In order to guarantee general agreement with observations for all ocean depths, we calculate a regional correlation index considering the impact of altimetry data and employ it for our final products. Except for the surface ocean, the pseudo salinity profiles show general improvements compared to the existing climatology and the reanalysis outputs from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's ensemble coupled data assimilation system. Near the surface layer, reanalysis outputs show a relatively high performance due to the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. An assimilation system produces reliable surface flux variability not accounted for the construction of the global pseudo salinity profiles. These results encourage the application of the global pseudo salinity profiles into an assimilation system for the 20th century when the observed salinity data are sparse."	0148-0227		FEB 1	2011	116							C02002	10.1029/2010JC006386

Introduction to coupled biogeochemical cycles	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT									"At the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of America, investigators of ecosystem science and biogeochemistry gathered in a series of sessions sponsored by the National Science Foundation to examine what is known about the coupling of chemical elements in biochemistry and thus in global biogeochemical cycles. As an introduction to the topic, this paper offers some philosophical thoughts about the origins and implications of coupled biogeochemical cycles on Earth. The chemical characteristics of Earth have carried the imprint of biology since the first appearance of life more than 3.5 billion years ago. Movements of about 30 chemical elements essential to life are coupled, so that the behavior of one element can often be used to predict the behavior of other elements - in both the natural and human-perturbed settings of the world. The coupling of biochemical elements stems from basic stoichiometry (the relative quantities of chemical elements in living biomass), the oxidation-reduction or ""redox"" reactions (in which one substance is oxidized [loses electrons] and another is reduced [gains electrons]) of metabolic activity, and chelation (in which a metal ion binds to an organic compound). Many anthropogenic environmental problems - climate change, eutrophication, acid precipitation, metal pollution - originate from the release of non-stoichiometric and toxic quantities of chemical elements to the environment. Geoengineering proposals as solutions to certain global environmental problems must be consistent with the underlying constraints of coupled biogeochemical cycles. Biogeochemistry has much to offer to policy makers, and biogeochemists must contribute to current deliberations about how to solve environmental problems."	1540-9295		FEB	2011	9	1			SI	5	8		10.1890/090235

Critical areas for research include: coupling of major element cycles to less studied yet equally important trace element cycles; analyzing CBCs across ecosystem boundaries; integrating experimental results into regional-and global-scale models; and expanding the analysis of human interactions with CBCs arising from human population growth, urbanization, and geoengineering.

Large-scale behavior and statistical equilibria in rotating flows	PHYSICAL REVIEW E									"We examine long-time properties of the ideal dynamics of three-dimensional flows, in the presence or not of an imposed solid-body rotation and with or without helicity (velocity-vorticity correlation). In all cases, the results agree with the isotropic predictions stemming from statistical mechanics. No accumulation of excitation occurs in the large scales, although, in the dissipative rotating case, anisotropy and accumulation, in the form of an inverse cascade of energy, are known to occur. We attribute this latter discrepancy to the linearity of the term responsible for the emergence of inertial waves. At intermediate times, inertial energy spectra emerge that differ somewhat from classical wave-turbulence expectations and with a trace of large-scale excitation that goes away for long times. These results are discussed in the context of partial two dimensionalization of the flow undergoing strong rotation as advocated by several authors."	1539-3755		JAN 28	2011	83	1	Part 2					16309	10.1103/PhysRevE.83.016309

Solar signal propagation: The role of gravity waves and stratospheric sudden warmings	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We use a troposphere-stratosphere model of intermediate complexity to study the atmospheric response to an idealized solar forcing in the subtropical upper stratosphere during Northern Hemisphere (NH) early winter. We investigate two conditions that could influence poleward and downward propagation of the response: (1) the representation of gravity wave effects and (2) the presence/absence of stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs). We also investigate how the perturbation influences the timing and frequency of SSWs. Differences in the poleward and downward propagation of the response within the stratosphere are found depending on whether Rayleigh friction (RF) or a gravity wave scheme (GWS) is used to represent gravity wave effects. These differences are likely related to differences in planetary wave activity in the GWS and RF versions, as planetary wave redistribution plays an important role in the downward and poleward propagation of stratospheric signals. There is also remarkable sensitivity in the tropospheric response to the representation of the gravity wave effects. It is most realistic for GWS. Further, tropospheric responses are systematically different dependent on the absence/presence of SSWs. When only years with SSWs are examined, the tropospheric signal appears to have descended from the stratosphere, while the signal in the troposphere appears disconnected from the stratosphere when years with SSWs are excluded. Different troposphere-stratosphere coupling mechanisms therefore appear to be dominant for years with and without SSWs. The forcing does not affect the timing of SSWs, but does result in a higher occurrence frequency throughout NH winter. Quasi-Biennial Oscillation effects were not included."	0148-0227		JAN 27	2011	116							D02118	10.1029/2010JD014535

According to Balan et al. (1998) the F(3) layer occurs mainly during the morning-noon period due to the combined effect of the upward E x B drift and the neutral wind that provides upward plasma drifts at and above the F(2) layer. The F(3) layer occurrence rate is higher in summer and decreases with increasing solar activity. In this study, the characteristic of the sunset F(3) layer is first investigated using a solar cycle of ionosonde data (1995-2010) from the magnetic equatorial station at Jicamarca, and compared with the features derived from the four subtropical stations at Sao Luis, Fortaleza, Kwajalein, and Vanimo. Evidence shows that the local time distribution of the occurrence of the F(3) layer can extend to the postsunset time (1800-2100 local time). The sunset F(3) layer has a strong seasonal dependence occurring mainly during the summertime. Unlike the daytime F(3) layer, the occurrence of the sunset F(3) layer clearly increases and the virtual height of the bottom side of the F(3) layer statistically increases from 620 to 1000 km with increasing solar activity. In addition, the occurrence of the sunset F(3) layer at the other stations is much less than that at Jicamarca. These features of the dependence on the season, solar activity, and latitude are clearly related to the geomagnetic control of the evening prereversal enhancement of the equatorial zonal electric field and geomagnetic configuration."	0148-0227		JAN 25	2011	116							A01313	10.1029/2010JA016111

The maximum Fe abundance occurs in late autumn (early May) at Rothera, rather than in midwinter. A secondary Fe enhancement occurs 6 months later in late spring (October-November) prior to the formation of polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) layers in summer. The midsummer Fe layer is 3 km lower at Rothera because Fe depletion by PMC layers near the mesopause is not as extensive or as complete as at the South Pole. These observations are modeled satisfactorily using a mesospheric one-dimensional Fe chemistry model driven by a general circulation model and including a detailed micrometeoroid flux and ablation model. Our study shows that the autumnal maximum in the Fe abundance is caused primarily by the seasonal temperature maximum in the mesopause region, reinforced by the seasonal peak in the meteor input function (MIF). The Fe abundance at Rothera declines throughout the winter in response to the decrease in the MIF and the slowly falling temperatures. The modeled Fe injection rate is similar to 5 times smaller while the eddy diffusivity values between 80 and 90 km are 4.1 times smaller than the corresponding values used in the South Pole model. This comparison demonstrates the sensitivity of the metal atom densities to the balance between injection by meteoric ablation and removal by downward transport."	0148-0227		JAN 22	2011	116							D02304	10.1029/2010JD014655

The terminator and the magnetically conjugate points for the terminator in the other hemisphere have been plotted on top of global maps of COSMIC NmF(2) and hmF(2) for 2 months either side of the December and June solstices for 2006-2008. These plots show that there are distinct enhancements of NmF(2) and increases in hmF(2) as soon as the conjugate footprint of the field line on the winter terminator is seen at middle latitudes in the summer hemisphere. This effect is most pronounced where the WSA is formed, but it also occurs across the South Pacific Ocean in the southern summer and across much of the North Atlantic Ocean, Siberia, and Kamchatka during the northern summer. An hmF(2) increase occurs between the two terminators even at locations where there is no increase in NmF(2). A similar, but reversed, effect occurs in hmF(2) near dawn. This behavior appears to be most consistent with upward and poleward ion drifts in the evening, but neutral wind and downward precipitation may make important contributions to this effect."	0148-0227		JAN 22	2011	116							A01311	10.1029/2010JA015648

Aerosol effects on the development of a supercell storm in a double-moment bulk-cloud microphysics scheme	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"This study investigates the aerosol effects on the development of an idealized three-dimensional supercell storm, focusing on storm morphology and precipitation during a quasi steady state of a storm. The impact of the aerosol concentration on the simulated storm is evaluated by varying the initial cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration in the Weather Research and Forecasting Double-Moment Six-Class microphysics scheme. A right-moving, quasi-steady supercell with two diverging echo masses was reproduced, compared with the previous modeling study. In the experiment with a high CCN number concentration, storm intensity was weakened, and surface precipitation was reduced. On the other hand, the simulation that excluded the graupel substance produced a weaker low-level downdraft, thus less near-surface vorticity, compared with the simulation that included graupel. The CCN number concentrations did not affect the storm structures in the absence of graupel. In addition, the aerosol effects on the surface precipitation with respect to the initial CCN value were diametrically opposed. The major reason for the different responses to aerosol can be attributed to the exaggerated snow mass loading across the convective core when the graupel species is excluded. The results indicate that graupel species and related microphysics are crucial to the realistic representation of the aerosol-precipitation interactions within a supercell storm."	0148-0227		JAN 21	2011	116							D02204	10.1029/2010JD014128

We focus the bulk of our analysis on interpreting the thermal and spatial dependence of the non-thermal line widths in the ECH as measured by SOHO/SUMER by placing the measurements in context with recent studies of ubiquitous Alfven waves in the solar atmosphere and line profile asymmetries (indicative of episodic heating and mass loading of the coronal plasma) that originate in the strong, unipolar magnetic flux concentrations that comprise the supergranular network. The results presented in this paper are consistent with a picture where a significant portion of the energy responsible for the transport of heated mass into the fast solar wind is provided by episodically occurring small-scale events (likely driven by magnetic reconnection) in the upper chromosphere and transition region of the strong magnetic flux regions that comprise the supergranular network."	0004-637X		JAN 20	2011	727	1						7	10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/7

Future climate change in the Southern Hemisphere: Competing effects of ozone and greenhouse gases	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Future anthropogenic climate change in the Southern Hemisphere is likely to be driven by two opposing effects, stratospheric ozone recovery and increasing greenhouse gases. We examine simulations from two coupled climate models in which the details of these two forcings are known. While both models suggest that recent positive summertime trends in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) will reverse sign over the coming decades as the ozone hole recovers, climate sensitivity appears to play a large role in modifying the strength of their SAM response. Similar relationships are found between climate sensitivity and SAM trends when the analysis is extended to transient CO(2) simulations from other coupled models. Tropical upper tropospheric warming is found to be more relevant than polar stratospheric cooling to the intermodel variation in the SAM trends in CO(2)-only simulations. Citation: Arblaster, J.

Satellite-derived QuikSCAT winds and NOAA Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) measurements for the period of 2000-2006, together with reanalysis of winds from a longer record, are analyzed to understand the sources of this 40-60-day wind variability and the global propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) surface signatures. The results demonstrate that the MJO propagated eastward from the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic during winter and spring of 2002, causing 40-60 day wind variations in the equatorial Atlantic. The Isthmus of Panama appears to be a dominant pathway for these surface wind anomalies to propagate into the Atlantic, where they can produce important climate impacts. This result is consistent with previous work that has demonstrated a strong MJO influence on the North American Monsoon (NAM) region, and complements other work demonstrating the propagation of intraseasonal wind anomalies and accompanying sea level pressure signals associated with dry equatorial Kelvin waves that reach the Caribbean through the Panama gap.

A scaling theory for the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols suggests climate models underestimate the size of the global dust cycle	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA									"Mineral dust aerosols impact Earth's radiation budget through interactions with clouds, ecosystems, and radiation, which constitutes a substantial uncertainty in understanding past and predicting future climate changes. One of the causes of this large uncertainty is that the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols is poorly understood. The present study shows that regional and global circulation models (GCMs) overestimate the emitted fraction of clay aerosols (<2 mu m diameter) by a factor of similar to 2-8 relative to measurements. This discrepancy is resolved by deriving a simple theoretical expression of the emitted dust size distribution that is in excellent agreement with measurements. This expression is based on the physics of the scale-invariant fragmentation of brittle materials, which is shown to be applicable to dust emission. Because clay aerosols produce a strong radiative cooling, the overestimation of the clay fraction causes GCMs to also overestimate the radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust. On local and regional scales, this affects the magnitude and possibly the sign of the dust radiative forcing, with implications for numerical weather forecasting and regional climate predictions in dusty regions. On a global scale, the dust cycle in most GCMs is tuned to match radiative measurements, such that the overestimation of the radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust has likely caused GCMs to underestimate the global dust emission rate. This implies that the deposition flux of dust and its fertilizing effects on ecosystems may be substantially larger than thought."	0027-8424		JAN 18	2011	108	3				1016	1021		10.1073/pnas.1014798108

The boundary layer response to recent Arctic Sea ice loss and implications for high-latitude climate feedbacks	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"This study documents and evaluates the boundary layer and energy budget response to record low 2007 sea ice extents in the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) using 1-day observationally constrained forecasts and 10-yr runs with a freely evolving atmosphere. While near-surface temperature and humidity are minimally affected by sea ice loss in July 2007 forecasts, near-surface stability decreases and atmospheric humidity increases aloft over newly open water in September 2007 forecasts. Ubiquitous low cloud increases over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean are found in both the July 2007 and the September 2007 forecasts. In response to the 2007 sea ice loss, net surface [top of the atmosphere (TOA)] energy budgets change by +19.4 W m(-2) (+21.0 W m(-2)) and -17.9 W m(-2) (+1.4 W m(-2)) in the July 2007 and September 2007 forecasts, respectively. While many aspects of the forecasted response to sea ice loss are consistent with physical expectations and available observations, CAM4's ubiquitous July 2007 cloud increases over newly open water are not. The unrealistic cloud response results from the global application of parameterization designed to diagnose stratus clouds based on lower-tropospheric stability (CLDST). In the Arctic, the well-mixed boundary layer assumption implicit in CLDST is violated. Requiring a well-mixed boundary layer to diagnose stratus clouds improves the CAM4 cloud response to sea ice loss and increases July 2007 surface (TOA) energy budgets over newly open water by +11 W m(-2) (+14.9 W m(-2)). Of importance to high-latitude climate feedbacks, unrealistic stratus cloud compensation for sea ice loss occurs only when stable and dry atmospheric conditions exist. Therefore, coupled climate projections that use CAM4 will underpredict Arctic sea ice loss only when dry and stable summer conditions occur."	0894-8755		JAN 15	2011	24	2				428	447		10.1175/2010JCLI3651.1

Dynamical tropopause based on isentropic potential vorticity gradients	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"Since its inception, the dynamical tropopause based on potential vorticity (PV) is identified by the PV gradient on isentropes. Conceptually, significant isentropic gradients shown on the middle world PV maps reflect the underlying transport barrier associated with the tropopause, formed by jet streams that separate tropospheric air masses at low latitudes and stratospheric air masses at high latitudes. Largely owing to the lack of a general method, the dynamical tropopause has often been represented by a PV value chosen ad hoc without any temporal or spatial differentiation. In this work, we present a method for determining the PV isoline of the dynamical tropopause based on the isentropic PV gradients. Using 1 year of data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the spatial and temporal variability of this PV gradient-based dynamical tropopause is examined. The results show that in general there is a broad distribution of PV values at the dynamical tropopause, ranging from 1.5 to 5 potential vorticity units. Therefore, a fixed PV surface for all isentropes and seasons does not accurately represent the location of the ""tropopause barrier."" The PV at the dynamical tropopause increases with increasing potential temperature. This increase is more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. The seasonal cycle shows higher PV values at the dynamical tropopause during summer than during winter. This seasonal cycle is larger on higher isentropes. The dispersion of the PV at the dynamical tropopause about its mean is twofold larger during summer and autumn than during winter and spring in both hemispheres."	0148-0227		JAN 14	2011	116							D01110	10.1029/2010JD014343

The vertical distribution of ozone instantaneous radiative forcing from satellite and chemistry climate models	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"We evaluate the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) of tropospheric ozone predicted by four state-of-the-art global chemistry climate models (AM2-Chem, CAM-Chem, ECHAM5-MOZ, and GISS-PUCCINI) against ozone distribution observed from the NASA Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) during August 2006. The IRF is computed through the application of an observationally constrained instantaneous radiative forcing kernels (IRFK) to the difference between TES and model-predicted ozone. The IRFK represent the sensitivity of outgoing longwave radiation to the vertical and spatial distribution of ozone under all-sky condition. Through this technique, we find total tropospheric IRF biases from -0.4 to + 0.7 W/m(2) over large regions within the tropics and midlatitudes, due to ozone differences over the region in the lower and middle troposphere, enhanced by persistent bias in the upper troposphere-lower stratospheric region. The zonal mean biases also range from -30 to + 50 mW/m(2) for the models. However, the ensemble mean total tropospheric IRF bias is less than 0.2 W/m(2) within the entire troposphere."	0148-0227		JAN 13	2011	116							D01305	10.1029/2010JD014243

Evidence of liquid dependent ice nucleation in high-latitude stratiform clouds from surface remote sensors	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS									"Ground-based lidar, radar and microwave radiometer observations at Eureka, Canada, Barrow, Alaska and over the western Arctic Ocean measure physical characteristics and morphology of stratiform clouds. Despite transition of a cold atmosphere (-15 C) through ice supersaturated conditions, ice is not observed until soon after a liquid layer. Several cases illustrating this phenomenon are presented in addition to long-term observations from three measurement sites characterizing cloud phase frequency. This analysis demonstrates that clouds composed entirely of ice occur less frequently than liquid-topped mixed-phase clouds at temperatures warmer than -25 to -30 C. These results indicate ice formation generally occurs in conjunction with liquid at these temperatures, and suggest the importance of liquid-dependent ice nucleation mechanisms.

A comparison of Arctic BrO measurements by chemical ionization mass spectrometry and long path-differential optical absorption spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES									"A measurement intensive was carried out in Barrow, Alaska, in spring 2009 as part of the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Snowpack (OASIS) program. The central focus of this campaign was the role of halogen chemistry in the Arctic. A chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) performed in situ bromine oxide (BrO) measurements. In addition, a long path-differential optical absorption spectrometer (LP-DOAS) measured the average concentration of BrO along light paths of either 7.2 or 2.1 km. A comparison of the 1 min observations from both instruments is presented in this work. The two measurements were highly correlated and agreed within their uncertainties (R(2) = 0.74, slope = 1.10, and intercept = -0.15 pptv). Better correlation was found (R(2) = 0.85, slope = 1.04, and intercept = -0.11 pptv) for BrO observations at moderate wind speeds (>3 m s(-1) and <8 m s(-1)) and low nitric oxide (NO) mixing ratios (<100 pptv). The improved agreement is likely due to the elimination of periods when the spatial distribution of BrO is inhomogeneous. The detection limit obtained for the CIMS was 2.6 pptv (3 sigma) for a 4 s integration period, and the estimated uncertainty was similar to 30%. The detection limits for the LP-DOAS ranged from 0.7 to 5 pptv (3 sigma) depending on the level of ambient light and the chosen light path, and the estimated systematic error was 10%. The agreement between the CIMS and LP-DOAS is excellent and demonstrates the capability of both instruments to selectively and accurately measure BrO with high sensitivity."	0148-0227		JAN 5	2011	116							D00R02	10.1029/2010JD014788

Effects of COX inhibitors on neurodegeneration and survival in mice exposed to the marine neurotoxin domoic acid	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS									"The marine neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) is a rigid analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate and a potent agonist of kainate subtype glutamate receptors. Persistent activation of these receptor subtypes results in rapid excitotoxicity, calcium-dependent cell death, and neuronal degeneration in regions of the brain where glutamatergic pathways are concentrated. Previous work has shown that DA promotes the expression of inflammatory genes in the brain, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). To investigate the impact of inflammation on the development of neurodegeneration, and ultimately survival following DA administration, we used selective (L745337, Merck) and non-selective (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) COX inhibitors in DA exposed mice. Adult male ICR mice were given a regime of either ASA or 123547 both before and after a single LD50 dose of DA. Mice were observed immediately after toxin introduction and then sacrificed at 2 days post exposure. Our lower dose of L23547 increased survival and was most effective at decreasing neuronal degeneration in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, areas especially sensitive to DA excitotoxicity. This study shows that COX2 plays a role in DA induced neurodegeneration and death, and that inhibitors may be of value for treatment in human and wildlife DA exposure.

Aerosol effects on the photochemistry in Mexico City during MCMA-2006/MILAGRO campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"In the present study, the impact of aerosols on the photochemistry in Mexico City is evaluated using the WRF-CHEM model for the period from 24 to 29 March during the MCMA-2006/MILAGRO campaign. An aerosol radiative module has been developed with detailed consideration of aerosol size, composition, and mixing. The module has been coupled into the WRF-CHEM model to calculate the aerosol optical properties, including optical depth, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor. Calculated aerosol optical properties are in good agreement with the surface observations and aircraft and satellite measurements during daytime. In general, the photolysis rates are reduced due to the absorption by carbonaceous aerosols, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon hours with a long aerosol optical path. However, with the growth of aerosol particles and the decrease of the solar zenith angle around noontime, aerosols can slightly enhance photolysis rates when ultraviolet (UV) radiation scattering dominates UV absorption by aerosols at the lower-most model layer. The changes in photolysis rates due to aerosols lead to about 2-17% surface ozone reduction during daytime in the urban area in Mexico City with generally larger reductions during early morning hours near the city center, resulting in a decrease of OH level by about 9%, as well as a decrease in the daytime concentrations of nitrate and secondary organic aerosols by 5-6% on average. In addition, the rapid aging of black carbon aerosols and the enhanced absorption of UV radiation by organic aerosols contribute substantially to the reduction of photolysis rates."	1680-7316			2011	11	11				5169	5182		10.5194/acp-11-5169-2011

Aerosol indirect effects in a multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Much of the large uncertainty in estimates of anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate arises from the multi-scale nature of the interactions between aerosols, clouds and dynamics, which are difficult to represent in conventional general circulation models (GCMs). In this study, we use a multi-scale aerosol-climate model that treats aerosols and clouds across multiple scales to study aerosol indirect effects. This multi-scale aerosol-climate model is an extension of a multi-scale modeling framework (MMF) model that embeds a cloud-resolving model (CRM) within each vertical column of a GCM grid. The extension allows a more physically-based treatment of aerosol-cloud interactions in both stratiform and convective clouds on the global scale in a computationally feasible way. Simulated model fields, including liquid water path (LWP), ice water path, cloud fraction, shortwave and longwave cloud forcing, precipitation, water vapor, and cloud droplet number concentration are in reasonable agreement with observations. The new model performs quantitatively similar to the previous version of the MMF model in terms of simulated cloud fraction and precipitation. The simulated change in shortwave cloud forcing from anthropogenic aerosols is -0.77 W m(-2), which is less than half of that (-1.79 W m(-2)) calculated by the host GCM (NCAR CAM5) with traditional cloud parameterizations and is also at the low end of the estimates of other conventional global aerosol-climate models. The smaller forcing in the MMF model is attributed to a smaller (3.9%) increase in LWP from preindustrial conditions (PI) to present day (PD) compared with 15.6% increase in LWP in stratiform clouds in CAM5. The difference is caused by a much smaller response in LWP to a given perturbation in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations from PI to PD in the MMF (about one-third of that in CAM5), and, to a lesser extent, by a smaller relative increase in CCN concentrations from PI to PD in the MMF (about 26% smaller than that in CAM5). The smaller relative increase in CCN concentrations in the MMF is caused in part by a smaller increase in aerosol lifetime from PI to PD in the MMF, a positive feedback in aerosol indirect effects induced by cloud lifetime effects from aerosols. The smaller response in LWP to anthropogenic aerosols in the MMF model is consistent with observations and with high resolution model studies, which may indicate that aerosol indirect effects simulated in conventional global climate models are overestimated and point to the need to use global high resolution models, such as MMF models or global CRMs, to study aerosol indirect effects. The simulated total anthropogenic aerosol effect in the MMF is -1.05 W m(-2), which is close to the Murphy et al. (2009) inverse estimate of -1.1 +/- 0.4 W m(-2) (1 sigma) based on the examination of the Earth's energy balance. Further improvements in the representation of ice nucleation and low clouds in MMF are needed to refine the aerosol indirect effect estimate."	1680-7316			2011	11	11				5431	5455		10.5194/acp-11-5431-2011

The observations from 17 days in July-August 2004 (INTEX-NA field campaign) span a wide range of latitudes (28 degrees N-53 degrees N), longitudes (45 degrees W-140 degrees W), altitudes (0.1-11.9 km), ozone columns (285-353 DU), and solar zenith angles (2 degrees-85 degrees). Both cloudy and cloud-free conditions were encountered. For cloud-free conditions, the ratio of observed to clear-sky-model actinic flux (integrated from 298 to 422 nm) was 1.01 +/- 0.04, i.e. in good agreement with observations. The agreement improved to 1.00 +/- 0.03 for the down-welling component under clear sky conditions. In the presence of clouds and depending on their position relative to the aircraft, the up-welling component was frequently enhanced (by as much as a factor of 8 relative to cloud-free values) while the down-welling component showed both reductions and enhancements of up to a few tens of percent. Including all conditions, the ratio of the observed actinic flux to the cloud-free model value was 1.1 +/- 0.3 for the total, or separately 1.0 +/- 0.2 for the down-welling and 1.5 +/- 0.8 for the up-welling components. The correlations between up-welling and down-welling deviations are well reproduced with sensitivity studies using the TUV model, and are understood qualitatively with a simple conceptual model. This analysis of actinic flux observations illustrates opportunities for future evaluations of photolysis rates in three-dimensional chemistry-transport models."	1680-7316			2011	11	11				5457	5469		10.5194/acp-11-5457-2011

Isoprene suppression of new particle formation in a mixed deciduous forest	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Production of new particles over forests is an important source of cloud condensation nuclei that can affect climate. While such particle formation events have been widely observed, their formation mechanisms over forests are poorly understood. Our observations made in a mixed deciduous forest with large isoprene emissions during the summer displayed a surprisingly rare occurrence of new particle formation (NPF). Typically, NPF events occur around noon but no NPF events were observed during the 5 weeks of measurements. The exceptions were two evening ultrafine particle events. During the day, sulfuric acid concentrations were in the 10(6) cm(-3) range with very low preexisting aerosol particles, a favorable condition for NPF to occur even during the summer. The ratio of emitted isoprene carbon to monoterpene carbon at this site was similar to that in Amazon rainforests (ratio > 10), where NPF events are also very rare, compared with a ratio <0.5 in Finland boreal forests, where NPF events are frequent. Our results suggest that large isoprene emissions can suppress NPF formation in forests although the underlying mechanism for the suppression is unclear.

Aims: To look for lagged responses of flowering phenology and effects on duration of reproductive phases. Methods: Treatment and post-treatment year phenological data from 12 species in a 1-year step warming and double precipitation experiment was examined. Results: Changes in phenology due to the previous year's warming were in the opposite direction to those observed during the treatment year. Six species responded to warming in 2004, delaying flowering 6.2 days and fruiting 7.9 days. Unlike 2003, no species advanced flowering phenology in 2004. Delays resulted from a soil moisture deficit in formerly warmed plots that lasted 3 months or more after warming ended. Increased precipitation altered phenology in one species but did not affect duration of reproductive phases. While 10 of 11 responsive species entered bud phase earlier under warming than in controls in 2003, in only two species showed a phenological delay at the beginning of the bud phase in 2004. Warming tended to shorten flowering and fruiting stages and total duration in spring annuals. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that climate anomalies can influence phenology in the following year, here due to a lag in soil moisture recharge."	1755-0874			2011	4	1				23	35		10.1080/17550874.2011.557669

Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Nina-like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El-Nino-like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21(st) century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20-50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical SSTs. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Multi-scale modeling study of the source contributions to near-surface ozone and sulfur oxides levels over California during the ARCTAS-CARB period	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Chronic high surface ozone (O(3)) levels and the increasing sulfur oxides (SO(x) = SO(2)+SO(4)) ambient concentrations over South Coast (SC) and other areas of California (CA) are affected by both local emissions and long-range transport. In this paper, multi-scale tracer, full-chemistry and adjoint simulations using the STEM atmospheric chemistry model are conducted to assess the contribution of local emission sourcesto SC O(3) and to evaluate the impacts of transported sulfur and local emissions on the SC sulfur budget-during the ARCTAS-CARB experiment period in 2008. Sensitivity simulations quantify contributions of biogenic and fire emissions to SC O(3) levels. California biogenic and fire emissions contribute 3-4 ppb to near-surface O(3) over SC, with larger contributions to other regions in CA. During a long-range transport event from Asia starting from 22 June, high SO(x) levels (up to similar to 0.7 ppb of SO(2) and similar to 1.3 ppb of SO(4)) is observed above similar to 6 km, but they did not affect CA surface air quality. The elevated SO(x) observed at 1-4 km is estimated to enhance surface SO(x) over SC by similar to 0.25 ppb (upper limit) on similar to 24 June. The near-surface SO(x) levels over SC during the flight week are attributed mostly to local emissions. Two anthropogenic SO(x) emission inventories (EIs) from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are compared and applied in 60 km and 12 km chemical transport simulations, and the results are compared with observations. The CARB EI shows improvements over the National Emission Inventory (NEI) by EPA, but generally underestimates surface SC SO(x) by about a factor of two. Adjoint sensitivity analysis indicated that SO(2) levels at 00:00 UTC (17:00 local time) at six SC surface sites were influenced by previous day maritime emissions over the ocean, the terrestrial emissions over nearby urban areas, and by transported SO(2) from the north through both terrestrial and maritime areas. Overall maritime emissions contribute 10-70% of SO(2) and 20-60% fine SO(4) on-shore and over the most terrestrial areas, with contributions decreasing with inland distance from the coast. Maritime emissions also modify the photochemical environment, shifting O(3) production over coastal SC to more VOC-limited conditions. These suggest an important role for shipping emission controls in reducing fine particle and O(3) concentrations in SC."	1680-7316			2011	11	7				3173	3194		10.5194/acp-11-3173-2011

Aerosol plume transport and transformation in high spectral resolution lidar measurements and WRF-Flexpart simulations during the MILAGRO Field Campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) experiences high loadings of atmospheric aerosols from anthropogenic sources, biomass burning and wind-blown dust. This paper uses a combination of measurements and numerical simulations to identify different plumes affecting the basin and to characterize transformation inside the plumes. The High Spectral Resolution Lidar on board the NASA LaRC B-200 King Air aircraft measured extinction coefficients and extinction to backscatter ratio at 532 nm, and backscatter coefficients and depolarization ratios at 532 and 1064 nm. These can be used to identify aerosol types. The measurement curtains are compared with particle trajectory simulations using WRF-Flexpart for different source groups. The good correspondence between measurements and simulations suggests that the aerosol transport is sufficiently well characterized by the models to estimate aerosol types and ages. Plumes in the basin undergo complex transport, and are frequently mixed together. Urban aerosols are readily identifiable by their low depolarization ratios and high lidar ratios, and dust by the opposite properties. Fresh biomass burning plumes have very low depolarization ratios which increase rapidly with age. This rapid transformation is consistent with the presence of atmospheric tar balls in the fresh plumes."	1680-7316			2011	11	7				3543	3563		10.5194/acp-11-3543-2011

First space-based derivation of the global atmospheric methanol emission fluxes	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1 emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source totals 187 Tg yr(-1) with a contribution of 100 Tg yr(-1) from plants, only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr(-1). Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 %) and Indonesia (up to 58 %), whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20-25 %) and Central Africa (25-35 %). On the other hand, the biogenic source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2), probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions. Detailed comparisons of the model with a number of aircraft and surface observations of methanol, as well as new methanol measurements in Europe and in the Reunion Island show that the satellite-derived methanol emissions improve significantly the agreement with the independent data, giving thus credence to the IASI dataset."	1680-7316			2011	11	10				4873	4898		10.5194/acp-11-4873-2011

A comparison of OEM CO retrievals from the IASI and MOPITT instruments	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES									"Observations of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) can only be made on continental and global scales by remote sensing instruments situated in space. One such instrument is the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), producing spectrally resolved, top-of-atmosphere radiance measurements from which CO vertical layers and total columns can be retrieved. This paper presents a technique for intercomparisons of satellite data with low vertical resolution. The example in the paper also generates the first intercomparison between an IASI CO data set, in this case that produced by the University of Leicester IASI Retrieval Scheme (ULIRS), and the V3 and V4 operationally retrieved CO products from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument. The comparison is performed for a localised region of Africa, primarily for an ocean day-time configuration, in order to develop the technique for instrument intercomparison in a region with well defined a priori. By comparing both the standard data and a special version of MOPITT data retrieved using the ULIRS a priori for CO, it is shown that standard intercomparisons of CO are strongly affected by the differing a priori data of the retrievals, and by the differing sensitivities of the two instruments. In particular, the differing a priori profiles for MOPITT V3 and V4 data result in systematic retrieved profile changes as expected. An application of averaging kernels is used to derive a difference quantity which is much less affected by smoothing error, and hence more sensitive to systematic error. These conclusions are confirmed by simulations with model profiles for the same region. This technique is used to show that for the data that has been processed the systematic bias between MOPITT V4 and ULIRS IASI data, at MOPITT vertical resolution, is less than 7% for the comparison data set, and on average appears to be less than 4%. The results of this study indicate that intercomparisons of satellite data sets with low vertical resolution should ideally be performed with: retrievals using a common a priori appropriate to the geographic region studied; the application of averaging kernels to compute difference quantities with reduced a priori influence; and a comparison with simulated differences using model profiles for the target gas in the region."	1867-1381			2011	4	5				775	793		10.5194/amt-4-775-2011

Emission factors for open and domestic biomass burning for use in atmospheric models	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Biomass burning (BB) is the second largest source of trace gases and the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles in the global troposphere. Many recent BB studies have provided new emission factor (EF) measurements. This is especially true for non-methane organic compounds (NMOC), which influence secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone formation. New EF should improve regional to global BB emissions estimates and therefore, the input for atmospheric models. In this work we present an up-to-date, comprehensive tabulation of EF for known pyrogenic species based on measurements made in smoke that has cooled to ambient temperature, but not yet undergone significant photochemical processing. All EFs are converted to one standard form (g compound emitted per kg dry biomass burned) using the carbon mass balance method and they are categorized into 14 fuel or vegetation types. Biomass burning terminology is defined to promote consistency. We compile a large number of measurements of biomass consumption per unit area for important fire types and summarize several recent estimates of global biomass consumption by the major types of biomass burning. Post emission processes are discussed to provide a context for the emission factor concept within overall atmospheric chemistry and also highlight the potential for rapid changes relative to the scale of some models or remote sensing products. Recent work shows that individual biomass fires emit significantly more gas-phase NMOC than previously thought and that including additional NMOC can improve photochemical model performance. A detailed global estimate suggests that BB emits at least 400 Tg yr(-1) of gas-phase NMOC, which is almost 3 times larger than most previous estimates. Selected recent results (e. g. measurements of HONO and the BB tracers HCN and CH(3)CN) are highlighted and key areas requiring future research are briefly discussed."	1680-7316			2011	11	9				4039	4072		10.5194/acp-11-4039-2011

Global and regional effects of the photochemistry of CH(3)O(2)NO(2): evidence from ARCTAS	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Using measurements from the NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) experiment, we show that methyl peroxy nitrate (CH(3)O(2)NO(2)) is present in concentrations of similar to 5-15 pptv in the springtime arctic upper troposphere. We investigate the regional and global effects of CH(3)O(2)NO(2) by including its chemistry in the GEOS-Chem 3-D global chemical transport model. We find that at temperatures below 240 K inclusion of CH(3)O(2)NO(2) chemistry results in decreases of up to similar to 20% in NO(x), similar to 20% in N(2)O(5), similar to 5% in HNO(3), similar to 2% in ozone, and increases in methyl hydrogen peroxide of up to similar to 14%. Larger changes are observed in biomass burning plumes lofted to high altitude. Additionally, by sequestering NO(x) at low temperatures, CH(3)O(2)NO(2) decreases the cycling of HO(2) to OH, resulting in a larger upper tropospheric HO(2) to OH ratio. These results may impact some estimates of lightning NO(x) sources as well as help explain differences between models and measurements of upper tropospheric composition."	1680-7316			2011	11	9				4209	4219		10.5194/acp-11-4209-2011

Scale interactions in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence	"ANNUAL REVIEW OF FLUID MECHANICS, VOL 43"	Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics								"This article reviews recent studies of scale interactions in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The present-day increase of computing power, which allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in conducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic field and between scales. in particular, processes such as induction and dynamo action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, and the development of anisotropies can be characterized at different scales. In this context we consider three different configurations often studied in the literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and nonlocal transfers are discussed for each case. Whereas the transfer between scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or nonlocal depending on the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity are also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assumptions in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or universality, is discussed."	0066-4189	978-0-8243-0743-1		2011	43					377	397		10.1146/annurev-fluid-122109-160748

Measurements of tropospheric HO(2) and RO(2) by oxygen dilution modulation and chemical ionization mass spectrometry	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES									"An improved method for the measurement of hydroperoxy radicals (HO(2)) and organic peroxy radicals (RO(2), where R is any organic group) has been developed that combines two previous chemical conversion/chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) peroxy radical measurement techniques. Applicable to both ground-based and aircraft platforms, the method provides good separation between HO(2) and RO(2), and frequent measurement capability with observations of both HO(2) and HO(2) + RO(2) amounts each minute. These improvements allow for analyses of measured [HO(2)]/[HO(2) + RO(2)] ratios on timescales relevant to tropospheric photochemistry. By varying both [NO] and [O(2)] simultaneously in the chemical conversion region of the PeRCIMS (Peroxy Radical CIMS) inlet, the method exploits the changing conversion efficiency of RO(2) to HO(2) under different inlet [NO]/[O(2)] to selectively observe either primarily HO(2) or the sum of HO(2) and RO(2). Two modes of operation have been established for ambient measurements: in the first half of the minute, RO(2) radicals are measured at close to 100% efficiency along with HO(2) radicals (low [NO]/[O(2)] = 2.53 x 10(-5)) and in the second half of the minute, HO(2) is detected while the majority of ambient RO(2) radicals are measured with low efficiency, approximately 15% (high [NO]/[O(2)] = 6.80 x 10(-4)). The method has been tested extensively in the laboratory under various conditions and for a variety of organic peroxy radicals relevant to the atmosphere and the results of these tests are presented. The modified PeRCIMS instrument has been deployed successfully using the new measurement technique on a number of aircraft campaigns, including on the NSF/NCAR C-130 during the MIRAGE-Mex and NASA INTEX-B field campaigns in the spring of 2006. A brief comparison of the peroxy radical measurements during these campaigns to a photochemical box model indicates good agreement under tropospheric conditions where NO(x) (NO + NO(2)) concentrations are lower than 0.5 ppbV (parts per billion by volume)."	1867-1381			2011	4	4				735	756		10.5194/amt-4-735-2011

This paper focuses on an RBF-QR formulation for node sets in one, two, and three dimensions. The algorithm is stable for arbitrarily small shape parameters. It can be used for thousands of node points in two dimensions and still more in three dimensions.

Measurements of atmospheric mercury in Shanghai during September 2009	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"We report on total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements made in Pudong, Shanghai in August/September 2009. The average TGM was 2.7 +/- 1.7 ng m(-3). This represents about 90% of the total atmospheric mercury. This is an underestimate for an annual-mean concentration because the meteorology in September favored predominantly easterly oceanic air, replaced in other seasons by airflow from industrial areas. The observed TGM follows a pattern seen in other cities around the world: a background elevated over mean hemispheric background (1.5 ng m(-3)), and pollution plumes of different magnitude and duration, interspersed with very sharp spikes of high concentration (60 ng m(-3)). The September 2009 Shanghai measurements are lower than those reported for most other Chinese cities and Mexico City, and similar to concentrations found in some Asian and in North American cities. Such comparisons are tenuous because of differences in season and year of the respective measurements. Our results should not be used for regulatory purposes.

Total Antarctic sea-ice extent does not show large interannual variations. However, large differences are observed on a regional/monthly scale, depending on prevailing winds and currents, and thus on the prevailing synoptic situations. The sea-ice edge is also a preferred region for cyclogenesis due to the strong meridional temperature gradient (high baroclinicity) in that area. The motivation for this study was to gain a better understanding of the interaction between sea-ice extent and the general atmospheric flow, particularly the frequency of warm-air intrusions into the interior of the Antarctic continent, since this influences precipitation seasonality and must be taken into account for a correct climatic interpretation of ice cores. Two case studies of extraordinary sea-ice concentration anomalies in relation to the prevailing atmospheric conditions are presented. However, both strong positive and negative anomalies can be related to warm biases in ice cores (indicated by stable-isotope ratios), especially in connection with the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode."	0260-3055			2011	52	57	Part 1			9	17

Projected changes in both snow cover and temperature are presented for a range of future emissions scenarios, and implications for the continued survival of the wolverine in the contiguous US are discussed. It is shown that under a high or medium-low emissions scenario there are likely to be dramatic reductions in spring snow cover in present-day wolverine habitats. Under these scenarios there is also likely to be a concomitant increase in summer-time temperatures, with projected maximum daily August temperatures far above those currently tolerated by the wolverine. It is likely that the wolverine, with its many adaptations for cold weather and deep snow pack, would have great difficulty adapting to such changes. The results of the simulations presented here suggest that the very low numbers of wolverines currently living in the contiguous US will likely further decline in response to the deterioration of their habitat in coming decades."	1748-9326		JAN-MAR	2011	6	1						14007	10.1088/1748-9326/6/1/014007
WOS:000289207700014	"Trenberth, KE"	"Trenberth, Kevin E."		Changes in precipitation with climate change	CLIMATE RESEARCH									"There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1 C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: 'it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid-to high latitudes: the 'rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. 'more bang for the buck', atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Nino a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture."	0936-577X			2011	47	1-2				123	138		10.3354/cr00953

Meteorological and trace gas factors affecting the number concentration of atmospheric Aitken (D(p)=50 nm) particles in the continental boundary layer: Parameterization using a multivariate mixed effects model	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT									"Measurements of aerosol size distribution and different gas and meteorological parameters, made in three polluted sites in Central and Southern Europe: Po Valley, Italy, Melpitz and Hohenpeissenberg in Germany, were analysed for this study to examine which of the meteorological and trace gas variables affect the number concentration of Aitken (D(p) = 50 nm) particles. The aim of our study was to predict the number concentration of 50 nm particles by a combination of in-situ meteorological and gas phase parameters. The statistical model needs to describe, amongst others, the factors affecting the growth of newly formed aerosol particles (below 10 nm) to 50 nm size, but also sources of direct particle emissions in that size range. As the analysis method we used multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model. Hourly averages of gas and meteorological parameters measured at the stations were used as predictor variables; the best predictive model was attained with a combination of relative humidity, new particle formation event probability, temperature, condensation sink and concentrations of SO(2), NO(2) and ozone. The seasonal variation was also taken into account in the mixed model structure. Model simulations with the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) indicate that the parameterization can be used as a part of a larger atmospheric model to predict the concentration of climatically active particles. As an additional benefit, the introduced model framework is, in theory, applicable for any kind of measured aerosol parameter."	1991-959X			2011	4	1				1	13		10.5194/gmd-4-1-2011

The multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF: Model description and evaluation	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT									"Anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate produce one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Much of this uncertainty arises from the multi-scale nature of the interactions between aerosols, clouds and large-scale dynamics, which are difficult to represent in conventional general circulation models (GCMs). In this study, we develop a multi-scale aerosol-climate model that treats aerosols and clouds across different scales, and evaluate the model performance, with a focus on aerosol treatment. This new model is an extension of a multi-scale modeling framework (MMF) model that embeds a cloud-resolving model (CRM) within each grid column of a GCM. In this extension, the effects of clouds on aerosols are treated by using an explicit-cloud parameterized-pollutant (ECPP) approach that links aerosol and chemical processes on the large-scale grid with statistics of cloud properties and processes resolved by the CRM. A two-moment cloud microphysics scheme replaces the simple bulk microphysics scheme in the CRM, and a modal aerosol treatment is included in the GCM. With these extensions, this multi-scale aerosol-climate model allows the explicit simulation of aerosol and chemical processes in both stratiform and convective clouds on a global scale. Simulated aerosol budgets in this new model are in the ranges of other model studies. Simulated gas and aerosol concentrations are in reasonable agreement with observations (within a factor of 2 in most cases), although the model underestimates black carbon concentrations at the surface by a factor of 2-4. Simulated aerosol size distributions are in reasonable agreement with observations in the marine boundary layer and in the free troposphere, while the model underestimates the accumulation mode number concentrations near the surface, and overestimates the accumulation mode number concentrations in the middle and upper free troposphere by a factor of about 2. The overestimation of accumulation model number concentrations in the middle and upper free troposphere is consistent with large aerosol mass fraction above 5 km in the MMF model compared with other models. Simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations are within the observational variations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are in reasonable agreement with observations (within a factor of 2), and the spatial distribution of AOD is consistent with observations, while the model underestimates AOD over regions with strong fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. Overall, this multi-scale aerosol-climate model simulates aerosol fields as well as conventional aerosol models."	1991-959X			2011	4	1				137	168		10.5194/gmd-4-137-2011

The effect of H(2)SO(4) - amine clustering on chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) measurements of gas-phase sulfuric acid	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"The state-of-the art method for measuring atmospheric gas-phase sulfuric acid is chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) based on nitrate reagent ions. We have assessed the possible effect of the sulfuric acid molecules clustering with base molecules on CIMS measurements using computational chemistry. From the computational data, three conclusions can be drawn. First, a significant fraction of the gas-phase sulfuric acid molecules are very likely clustered with amines if the amine concentration is around or above a few ppt. Second, some fraction of these acid-amine clusters may not be charged by the CIMS instrument, though the most reliable computational methods employed predict this fraction to be small; on the order of ten percent or less. Third, the amine molecules will evaporate practically immediately after charging, thus evading detection. These effects may need to be taken into account in the interpretation of atmospheric measurement data obtained using chemical ionization methods. The purpose of this study is not to criticize the CIMS method, but to help understand the implications of the measured results."	1680-7316			2011	11	6				3007	3019		10.5194/acp-11-3007-2011

Mass yields of secondary organic aerosols from the oxidation of alpha-pinene and real plant emissions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a significant source of global secondary organic aerosol (SOA); however, quantifying their aerosol forming potential remains a challenge. This study presents smog chamber laboratory work, focusing on SOA formation via oxidation of the emissions of two dominant tree species from boreal forest area, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies), by hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O(3)). Oxidation of alpha-pinene was also studied as a reference system. Tetramethylethylene (TME) and 2-butanol were added to control OH and O(3) levels, thereby allowing SOA formation events to be categorized as resulting from either OH-dominated or O(3)-initiated chemistry. SOA mass yields from alpha-pinene are consistent with previous studies while the yields from the real plant emissions are generally lower than that from alpha-pinene, varying from 1.9% at an aerosol mass loading of 0.69 mu g m(-3) to 17.7% at 26.0 mu g m(-3). Mass yields from oxidation of real plant emissions are subject to the interactive effects of the molecular structures of plant emissions and their reaction chemistry with OH and O(3), which lead to variations in condensable product volatility. SOA formation can be reproduced with a two-product gas-phase partitioning absorption model in spite of differences in the source of oxidant species and product volatility in the real plant emission experiments. Condensable products from OH-dominated chemistry showed a higher volatility than those from O(3)-initiated systems during aerosol growth stage. Particulate phase products became less volatile via aging process which continued after input gas-phase oxidants had been completely consumed."	1680-7316			2011	11	4				1367	1378		10.5194/acp-11-1367-2011

"Emulating coupled atmosphere-ocean and carbon cycle models with a simpler model, MAGICC6-Part 1: Model description and calibration"	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Current scientific knowledge on the future response of the climate system to human-induced perturbations is comprehensively captured by various model intercomparison efforts. In the preparation of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), intercomparisons were organized for atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and carbon cycle models, named ""CMIP3"" and ""C(4)MIP"", respectively. Despite their tremendous value for the scientific community and policy makers alike, there are some difficulties in interpreting the results. For example, radiative forcings were not standardized across the various AOGCM integrations and carbon cycle runs, and, in some models, key forcings were omitted. Furthermore, the AOGCM analysis of plausible emissions pathways was restricted to only three SRES scenarios. This study attempts to address these issues. We present an updated version of MAGICC, the simple carbon cycle-climate model used in past IPCC Assessment Reports with enhanced representation of time-varying climate sensitivities, carbon cycle feedbacks, aerosol forcings and ocean heat uptake characteristics. This new version, MAGICC6, is successfully calibrated against the higher complexity AOGCMs and carbon cycle models. Parameterizations of MAGICC6 are provided. The mean of the emulations presented here using MAGICC6 deviates from the mean AOGCM responses by only 2.2% on average for the SRES scenarios. This enhanced emulation skill in comparison to previous calibrations is primarily due to: making a ""like-with-like comparison"" using AOGCM-specific subsets of forcings; employing a new calibration procedure; as well as the fact that the updated simple climate model can now successfully emulate some of the climate-state dependent effective climate sensitivities of AOGCMs. The diagnosed effective climate sensitivity at the time of CO(2) doubling for the AOGCMs is on average 2.88 degrees C, about 0.33 degrees C cooler than the mean of the reported slab ocean climate sensitivities. In the companion paper (Part 2) of this study, we examine the combined climate system and carbon cycle emulations for the complete range of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios and the new RCP pathways."	1680-7316			2011	11	4				1417	1456		10.5194/acp-11-1417-2011

"Emulating atmosphere-ocean and carbon cycle models with a simpler model, MAGICC6-Part 2: Applications"	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Intercomparisons of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and carbon cycle models are important for galvanizing our current scientific knowledge to project future climate. Interpreting such intercomparisons faces major challenges, not least because different models have been forced with different sets of forcing agents. Here, we show how an emulation approach with MAGICC6 can address such problems. In a companion paper (Meinshausen et al., 2011a), we show how the lower complexity carbon cycle-climate model MAGICC6 can be calibrated to emulate, with considerable accuracy, globally aggregated characteristics of these more complex models. Building on that, we examine here the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project's Phase 3 results (CMIP3). If forcing agents missed by individual AOGCMs in CMIP3 are considered, this reduces ensemble average temperature change from pre-industrial times to 2100 under SRES A1B by 0.4 degrees C. Differences in the results from the 1980 to 1999 base period (as reported in IPCC AR4) to 2100 are negligible, however, although there are some differences in the trajectories over the 21st century. In a second part of this study, we consider the new RCP scenarios that are to be investigated under the forthcoming CMIP5 intercomparison for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. For the highest scenario, RCP8.5, relative to pre-industrial levels, we project a median warming of around 4.6 degrees C by 2100 and more than 7 degrees C by 2300. For the lowest RCP scenario, RCP3-PD, the corresponding warming is around 1.5 degrees C by 2100, decreasing to around 1.1 degrees C by 2300 based on our AOGCM and carbon cycle model emulations. Implied cumulative CO(2) emissions over the 21st century for RCP8.5 and RCP3-PD are 1881 GtC (1697 to 2034 GtC, 80% uncertainty range) and 381 GtC (334 to 488 GtC), when prescribing CO(2) concentrations and accounting for uncertainty in the carbon cycle. Lastly, we assess the reasons why a previous MAGICC version (4.2) used in IPCC AR4 gave roughly 10% larger warmings over the 21st century compared to the CMIP3 average. We find that forcing differences and the use of slightly too high climate sensitivities inferred from idealized high-forcing runs were the major reasons for this difference."	1680-7316			2011	11	4				1457	1471		10.5194/acp-11-1457-2011

Carbonaceous aerosols contributed by traffic and solid fuel burning at a polluted rural site in Northwestern England	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"The experiment presented in this paper was conducted at the Holme Moss site, which is located in the southern Pennines region in Northwestern England during November-December 2006. The strong southwesterly wind during the experimental period, which enhanced the transport of urban pollutants from the conurbations of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, in addition to the seasonally increased nearby residential heating activities, made this site a receptor for pollutants from a range of sources. A factor analysis is applied to the mass spectra of organic matter (OM) measured by the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) to attribute the pollutant sources. Besides the oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA), this site was found to contain a considerable fraction of primary organic aerosols (POA, mass fraction 50-70% within total mass of OM). The POA sources are attributed to be traffic emission and solid fuel burning, which are identified as hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) and solid fuel organic aerosol (SFOA) respectively. There were strongly combined emissions of black carbon (BC) particles from both sources. The refractory BC component (rBC) was characterized by a single particle soot photometer. This site began to be influenced during the late morning by fresh traffic emissions, whereas solid fuel burning became dominant from late afternoon until night. A covariance analysis of rBC and POA was used to derive source specific emission factors of 1.61 mu gHOA/mu grBC and 1.96 mu gHOA/mu grBC. The absorbing properties of aerosols were characterized at multiple wavelengths (lambda), and a stronger spectral dependence of absorption was observed when this site was significantly influenced by solid fuel burning. The rBC was estimated to contribute 3-16% of submicron aerosol mass. The single scattering albedo at lambda = 700 nm (SSA(700 nm)) was significantly anti-correlated with the rBC mass fraction, but also associated with the BC mixing state. The BC incorporation/removal process therefore may play a role in modulating the radiative properties of aerosols at the site under the influence of fresh sources. Given that traffic and residential combustion of solid fuels are significant contributors of carbonaceous aerosols over Europe, these results provide important source-specific information on modeling the anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosols."	1680-7316			2011	11	4				1603	1619		10.5194/acp-11-1603-2011

Characterizing summertime chemical boundary conditions for airmasses entering the US West Coast	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"The objective of this study is to analyze the pollution inflow into California during summertime and how it impacts surface air quality through combined analysis of a suite of observations and global and regional models. The focus is on the transpacific pollution transport investigated by the NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) mission in June 2008. Additional observations include satellite retrievals of carbon monoxide and ozone by the EOS Aura Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer (TES), aircraft measurements from the MOZAIC program and ozonesondes. We compare chemical boundary conditions (BC) from the MOZART-4 global model, which are commonly used in regional simulations, with measured concentrations to quantify both the accuracy of the model results and the variability in pollution inflow. Both observations and model reflect a large variability in pollution inflow on temporal and spatial scales, but the global model captures only about half of the observed free tropospheric variability. Model tracer contributions show a large contribution from Asian emissions in the inflow. Recirculation of local US pollution can impact chemical BC, emphasizing the importance of consistency between the global model simulations used for BC and the regional model in terms of emissions, chemistry and transport. Aircraft measurements in the free troposphere over California show similar concentration ranges, variability and source contributions as free tropospheric air masses over ocean, but caution has to be taken that local pollution aloft is not misinterpreted as inflow. A flight route specifically designed to sample boundary conditions during ARCTAS-CARB showed a prevalence of plumes transported from Asia and thus may not be fully representative for average inflow conditions. Sensitivity simulations with a regional model with altered BCs show that the temporal variability in the pollution inflow does impact modeled surface concentrations in California. We suggest that time and space varying chemical boundary conditions from global models provide useful input to regional models, but likely still lead to an underestimate of peak surface concentrations and the variability associated with long-range pollution transport."	1680-7316			2011	11	4				1769	1790		10.5194/acp-11-1769-2011

Forecasts and assimilation experiments of the Antarctic ozone hole 2008	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"The 2008 Antarctic ozone hole was one of the largest and most long-lived in recent years. Predictions of the ozone hole were made in near-real time (NRT) and hindcast mode with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The forecasts were carried out both with and without assimilation of satellite observations from multiple instruments to provide more realistic initial conditions. Three different chemistry schemes were applied for the description of stratospheric ozone chemistry: (i) a linearization of the ozone chemistry, (ii) the stratospheric chemical mechanism of the Model of Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 3, (MOZART-3) and (iii) the relaxation to climatology as implemented in the Transport Model, version 5, (TM5). The IFS uses the latter two schemes by means of a two-way coupled system. Without assimilation, the forecasts showed model-specific shortcomings in predicting start time, extent and duration of the ozone hole. The assimilation of satellite observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), the Solar Backscattering Ultraviolet radiometer (SBUV-2) and the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) led to a significant improvement of the forecasts when compared with total columns and vertical profiles from ozone sondes. The combined assimilation of observations from multiple instruments helped to overcome limitations of the ultraviolet (UV) sensors at low solar elevation over Antarctica. The assimilation of data from MLS was crucial to obtain a good agreement with the observed ozone profiles both in the polar stratosphere and troposphere. The ozone analyses by the three model configurations were very similar despite the different underlying chemistry schemes. Using ozone analyses as initial conditions had a very beneficial but variable effect on the predictability of the ozone hole over 15 days. The initialized forecasts with the MOZART-3 chemistry produced the best predictions of the increasing ozone hole whereas the linear scheme showed the best results during the ozonehole closure."	1680-7316			2011	11	5				1961	1977		10.5194/acp-11-1961-2011

Importance of secondary sources in the atmospheric budgets of formic and acetic acids	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"We present a detailed budget of formic and acetic acids, two of the most abundant trace gases in the atmosphere. Our bottom-up estimate of the global source of formic and acetic acids are similar to 1200 and similar to 1400 Gmol yr(-1), dominated by photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds, in particular isoprene. Their sinks are dominated by wet and dry deposition. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate this budget against an extensive suite of measurements from ground, ship and satellite-based Fourier transform spectrometers, as well as from several aircraft campaigns over North America. The model captures the seasonality of formic and acetic acids well but generally underestimates their concentration, particularly in the Northern midlatitudes. We infer that the source of both carboxylic acids may be up to 50% greater than our estimate and report evidence for a long-lived missing secondary source of carboxylic acids that may be associated with the aging of organic aerosols. Vertical profiles of formic acid in the upper troposphere support a negative temperature dependence of the reaction between formic acid and the hydroxyl radical as suggested by several theoretical studies."	1680-7316			2011	11	5				1989	2013		10.5194/acp-11-1989-2011

Initiation of convection over the Black Forest mountains during COPS IOP15a	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY									"Doppler-On-Wheels radar observations made during the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS) on 12 August 2007 showed that precipitating clouds only developed between the north-south orientated Murg and Nagold Valleys of the northern Black Forest. The clouds produced moderate precipitation. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model run at 700m horizontal resolution in the inner domain was able to simulate the location of the precipitation. Insight is therefore gained into the physical mechanisms responsible for the initiation and development of the convection. Convergence lines resulting from thermally driven flows constrained the initial location of the convection within warm and moist cores produced by heating on elevated surfaces.

This includes networks of in situ and remote-sensing systems such as the Global Positioning System as well as a synergy of multi-wavelength passive and active remote-sensing instruments such as advanced radar and lidar systems. The COPS field phase was performed from 01 June to 31 August 2007 in a low-mountain area in southwestern Germany/eastern France covering the Vosges mountains, the Rhine valley and the Black Forest mountains. The collected data set covers the entire evolution of convective precipitation events in complex terrain from their initiation, to their development and mature phase until their decay. Eighteen Intensive Observation Periods with 37 operation days and eight additional Special Observation Periods were performed, providing a comprehensive data set covering different forcing conditions. In this article, an overview of the COPS scientific strategy, the field phase, and its first accomplishments is given. Highlights of the campaign are illustrated with several measurement examples. It is demonstrated that COPS research provides new insight into key processes leading to convection initiation and to the modification of precipitation by orography, in the improvement of quantitative precipitation forecasting by the assimilation of new observations, and in the performance of ensembles of convection-permitting models in complex terrain.

The study region included the Vosges Mountains of France, the Rhine Valley which straddles France and Germany, the Black Forest Mountains and the Swabian Mountains of Germany. Convection occurred frequently during the summer months throughout the study region. The CI density (number of initiations per square km) illustrates preferential formation in the mountain regions while the CE events spanned both mountains and valleys nearly equally. There is a strong mid-day peak of the CI events suggesting that diurnal heating is critical for CI in the region. The very strong thunderstorms (> 46 dBZ) first occurred in the mountains and similar to 2 h later in the Rhine Valley. During the summer of 2007, the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS) field campaign was conducted with the objective of obtaining improved understanding of convective processes and short-term quantitative precipitation forecasting in low-mountain regions. Comparisons were made between the radar climatology results and the COPS summer. The COPS summer exhibited preferential CI density in the mountainous regions but not as pronounced as the climatology. The COPS summer had a similar diurnal peak of CI events as climatology but the ratio of daytime to nighttime CI (1.7), or amplitude of the diurnal cycle, was less than that of climatology (3.0). While both the 8-year climatology and COPS summer were dominated by daytime, locally-forced CI occurrences, the broad distribution of daytime CI events and increase in nighttime events observed during COPS indicate a more active synoptic pattern in 2007.

Desert dust and anthropogenic aerosol interactions in the Community Climate System Model coupled-carbon-climate model	BIOGEOSCIENCES									"Coupled-carbon-climate simulations are an essential tool for predicting the impact of human activity onto the climate and biogeochemistry. Here we incorporate prognostic desert dust and anthropogenic aerosols into the CCSM3.1 coupled carbon-climate model and explore the resulting interactions with climate and biogeochemical dynamics through a series of transient anthropogenic simulations (20th and 21st centuries) and sensitivity studies. The inclusion of prognostic aerosols into this model has a small net global cooling effect on climate but does not significantly impact the globally averaged carbon cycle; we argue that this is likely to be because the CCSM3.1 model has a small climate feedback onto the carbon cycle. We propose a mechanism for including desert dust and anthropogenic aerosols into a simple carbon-climate feedback analysis to explain the results of our and previous studies. Inclusion of aerosols has statistically significant impacts on regional climate and biogeochemistry, in particular through the effects on the ocean nitrogen cycle and primary productivity of altered iron inputs from desert dust deposition."	1726-4170			2011	8	2				387	414		10.5194/bg-8-387-2011

The altitude of snow growth by riming and vapor deposition in mixed-phase orographic clouds	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"Oxygen isotopic ratios (delta(18)O) and sulfate concentrations were measured in cloud water and snow collected at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) during winter, 2007. The rimed mass fraction (RMF) was estimated as the ratio of sulfate concentration in snow to that in cloud water. A sharp increase in the RMF at mean droplet diameters above 10 mu m confirmed the expected relationship between riming efficiency and cloud droplet size. The mass-weighted altitude of snow formation was inferred from delta(18)O in cloud water and snow and did not exceed 300 in above SPL. The mass-weighted altitude of snow growth by vapor deposition alone was no higher than 900 m above SPL. The results suggest that snow crystals nucleated under water-sub-saturated conditions at higher elevations attained a significant fraction of their water content as they grew by riming and vapor deposition in transit through the low-level orographic cloud near the mountain crest. This approach provides a direct means of validating model simulations of snow growth processes in cold mountain clouds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their quantification has been challenging due to the complex nature of the land surface amongst other reasons. One of the difficult parts in the quantification is the effect of vegetation that are related to land surface processes such as soil moisture variation and to atmospheric conditions such as radiation. This study addresses various relational investigations among vegetation properties such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), surface temperature (TSK), and vegetation water content (VegWC) derived from satellite sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). The study provides general information about a physiological behavior of vegetation for various environmental conditions. Second, using a coupled mesoscale/land surface model, we examine the effects of vegetation and its relationship with soil moisture on the simulated land-atmospheric interactions through the model sensitivity tests. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was selected for this study, and the Noah land surface model (Noah LSM) implemented in the WRF model was used for the model coupled system. This coupled model was tested through two parameterization methods for vegetation fraction using MODIS data and through model initialization of soil moisture from High Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS). Finally, this study evaluates the model improvements for each simulation method."	1998-9563			2011	42	2-3				95	112		10.2166/nh.2011.071

A geostationary thermal infrared sensor to monitor the lowermost troposphere: O(3) and CO retrieval studies	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES									"This paper describes the capabilities of a nadir thermal infrared (TIR) sensor proposed for deployment on-board a geostationary platform to monitor ozone (O(3)) and carbon monoxide (CO) for air quality (AQ) purposes. To assess the capabilities of this sensor we perform idealized retrieval studies considering typical atmospheric profiles of O(3) and CO over Europe with different instrument configuration (signal to noise ratio, SNR, and spectral sampling interval, SSI) using the KOPRA forward model and the KOPRA-fit retrieval scheme. We then select a configuration, referred to as GEO-TIR, optimized for providing information in the lowermost troposphere (LmT; 0-3 km in height). For the GEO-TIR configuration we obtain similar to 1.5 degrees of freedom for O(3) and similar to 2 for CO at altitudes between 0 and 15 km. The error budget of GEO-TIR, calculated using the principal contributions to the error (namely, temperature, measurement error, smoothing error) shows that information in the LmT can be achieved by GEO-TIR. We also retrieve analogous profiles from another geostationary infrared instrument with SNR and SSI similar to the Meteosat Third Generation Infrared Sounder (MTG-IRS) which is dedicated to numerical weather prediction, referred to as GEO-TIR2. We quantify the added value of GEO-TIR over GEO-TIR2 for a realistic atmosphere, simulated using the chemistry transport model MOCAGE (MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique a Grande Echelle). Results show that GEO-TIR is able to capture well the spatial and temporal variability in the LmT for both O(3) and CO. These results also provide evidence of the significant added value in the LmT of GEO-TIR compared to GEO-TIR2 by showing GEO-TIR is closer to MOCAGE than GEO-TIR2 for various statistical parameters (correlation, bias, standard deviation)."	1867-1381			2011	4	2				297	317		10.5194/amt-4-297-2011

Performance of the HOMME dynamical core in the aqua-planet configuration of NCAR CAM4: Equatorial waves	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE									"A new atmospheric dynamical core, named the High Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME), has been recently included in the NCAR-Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). It is a petascale capable high-order element-based conservative dynamical core developed on a cubed-sphere grid. We have examined the model simulations with HOMME using the aqua-planet mode of CAM4 (atmospheric component of CCSM4) and evaluated its performance in simulating the equatorial waves, considered a crucial element of climate variability. For this we compared the results with two other established models in CAM4 framework, which are the finite-volume (FV) and Eulerian spectral (EUL) dynamical cores. Although the gross features seem to be comparable, important differences have been found among the three dynamical cores. The phase speed of Kelvin waves in HOMME is faster and more satisfactory than those in FV and EUL. The higher phase speed is attributed to an increased large-scale precipitation in the upper troposphere and a more top-heavy heating structure. The variance of the n = 1 equatorial Rossby waves is underestimated by all three of them, but comparatively HOMME simulations are more reasonable. For the n = 0 eastward inertio-gravity waves, the variances are weak and phase speeds are too slow, scaled to shallow equivalent depths. However, the variance in HOMME is relatively more compared to the two other dynamical cores. The mixed Rossby-gravity waves are feeble in all the three cases. In summary, model simulations using HOMME are reasonably good, with some improvement relative to FV and EUL in capturing some of the important characteristics associated with equatorial waves."	0992-7689			2011	29	2				221	227		10.5194/angeo-29-221-2011

Influence of convection and aerosol pollution on ice cloud particle effective radius	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Satellite observations show that ice cloud effective radius (r(e)) increases with ice water content (IWC) but decreases with aerosol optical thickness (AOT). Using least-squares fitting to the observed data, we obtain an analytical formula to describe the variations of r(e) with IWC and AOT for several regions with distinct characteristics of r(e)-IWC-AOT relationships. As IWC directly relates to convective strength and AOT represents aerosol loading, our empirical formula provides a means to quantify the relative roles of dynamics and aerosols in controlling r(e) in different geographical regions, and to establish a framework for parameterization of aerosol effects on r(e) in climate models."	1680-7316			2011	11	2				457	463		10.5194/acp-11-457-2011

Eddy covariance VOC emission and deposition fluxes above grassland using PTR-TOF	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Eddy covariance (EC) is the preferable technique for flux measurements since it is the only direct flux determination method. It requires a continuum of high time resolution measurements (e.g. 5-20 Hz). For volatile organic compounds (VOC) soft ionization via proton transfer reaction has proven to be a quantitative method for real time mass spectrometry; here we use a proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF) for 10 Hz EC measurements of full mass spectra up to m/z 315. The mass resolution of the PTR-TOF enabled the identification of chemical formulas and separation of oxygenated and hydrocarbon species exhibiting the same nominal mass. We determined 481 ion mass peaks from ambient air concentration above a managed, temperate mountain grassland in Neustift, Stubai Valley, Austria. During harvesting we found significant fluxes of 18 compounds distributed over 43 ions, including protonated parent compounds, as well as their isotopes and fragments and VOC-H(+) - water clusters. The dominant BVOC fluxes were methanol, acetaldehyde, ethanol, hexenal and other C(6) leaf wound compounds, acetone, acetic acid, monoterpenes and sequiterpenes. The smallest reliable fluxes we determined were less than 0.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1), as in the case of sesquiterpene emissions from freshly cut grass. Terpenoids, including mono-and sesquiterpenes, were also deposited to the grassland before and after the harvesting. During cutting, total VOC emission fluxes up to 200 nmolC m(-2) s(-1) were measured. Methanol emissions accounted for half of the emissions of oxygenated VOCs and a third of the carbon of all measured VOC emissions during harvesting."	1680-7316			2011	11	2				611	625		10.5194/acp-11-611-2011

This region is characterized by strong coastal upwelling, the coolest SSTs in the tropical belt, and is home to the largest subtropical stratocumulus deck on Earth. The field intensive phase of VOCALS-REx took place during October and November 2008 and constitutes a critical part of a broader CLIVAR program (VOCALS) designed to develop and promote scientific activities leading to improved understanding, model simulations, and predictions of the southeastern Pacific (SEP) coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system, on diurnal to interannual timescales. The other major components of VOCALS are a modeling program with a model hierarchy ranging from the local to global scales, and a suite of extended observations from regular research cruises, instrumented moorings, and satellites. The two central themes of VOCALS-REx focus upon (a) links between aerosols, clouds and precipitation and their impacts on marine stratocumulus radiative properties, and (b) physical and chemical couplings between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere, including the role that mesoscale ocean eddies play. A set of hypotheses designed to be tested with the combined field, monitoring and modeling work in VOCALS is presented here. A further goal of VOCALS-REx is to provide datasets for the evaluation and improvement of large-scale numerical models.

The measured aerosol concentrations indicated that the Beijing region was highly polluted by aerosol particles. The impact of heavy aerosol particle loadings on cloud formation is studied. The microphysical characters of clouds (including number concentrations of cloud droplets (Nc), cloud droplet radius (Rc), liquid water content (LWC)), and number concentrations of aerosol particles (Na) were measured during the experiments. The aircraft measurements indicated that under high aerosol particle conditions, large number of cloud droplets was formed with small size of droplets. By contrast, under low aerosol particle conditions, the formation of cloud droplets was limited by the number of Na. In this case, small number of cloud droplets was formed with large size of droplets. The number concentrations of cloud droplets were sensitivity to LWC under high aerosol particle conditions. With low LWC value (<0.1 g m(-3)), the Nc was slowly increased with the Na. For example, the cloud droplets were increased from 200 to 300 cm(-3), while aerosol particles were increased from 1000 to 6000 cm(-3), indicating that a large amount of aerosol particles were unchanged under low LWC condition. By contrast, with high LWC value (>0.5 g m(-3)), the activation of aerosol particles to become cloud droplets was significantly enhanced. For example, the cloud droplets were increased from 700 to 1900 cm(-3), while aerosol particles were increased from 1000 to 6000 cm-3, suggesting that a large amount of aerosol particles were converted to cloud droplets when there were enough LWC for supporting such conversions. This study also suggests that the Rc was also very sensitivity to the LWC values. The increase in the LWC values led to significant increase in the size of cloud droplets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An ensemble assessment of regional ozone model uncertainty with an explicit error representation	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"In this paper, we examine the extent to which an ensemble generated from a single air quality model correctly represents the global uncertainty of ozone simulations with a regional scale chemistry-transport model and whether it is suitable for ozone data assimilation. An ensemble of 30 members is constructed from a reference simulation in which the model parameters that are the most uncertain for determining ozone concentrations are randomly perturbed. Comparisons of the simulated ensemble using the model CHIMERE with observations are examined over the summer season both at the surface and higher in the troposphere. Although the ensemble overestimates vertical and horizontal correlation between errors, the average model error is well represented both at the surface and in the vertical dimension (after an adjustment for the latter).

Intercomparison of Ground-Based Velocity Track Display (GBVTD)-retrieved circulation centers and structures of Hurricane Danny (1997) from two coastal WSR-88Ds	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"A plausible primary circulation and circulation center of a tropical cyclone (TC) can be deduced from a coastal Doppler radar using the ground-based velocity track display (GBVTD) technique and the GBVTD-simplex algorithm. The quality of the retrieved primary circulation is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the circulation center that can only be estimated from the degree of scattering of all possible centers obtained in GBVTD-simplex analyses from a single radar in real TCs. This study extends previous work to examine the uncertainties in the GBVTD-simplex-derived circulation centers and the GBVTD-derived primary circulations in Hurricane Danny (1997) sampled simultaneously from two Doppler radars [Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Dopplers (WSR-88Ds) in Mobile, Alabama, and Slidell, Louisiana] for 5 h. It is found that the mean difference between the individually computed GBVTD-simplex-derived centers is 2.13 km, similar to the estimates in previous studies. This value can be improved to 1.59 km by imposing time continuity in the radius of maximum wind, maximum mean tangential wind, and the center position in successive volumes. These additional physical criteria, not considered in previous work, stabilized the GBVTD-simplex algorithm and paved the way for automating the center finding and wind retrieval procedures in the future. Using the improved set of centers, Danny's axisymmetric tangential wind structures retrieved from each radar showed general agreement with systematic differences (up to 6 m s(-1)) in certain periods. The consistency in the wavenumber-1 tangential winds was not as good as their axisymmetric counterparts. It is suspected that the systematic differences in the axisymmetric tangential winds were caused by the unresolved wavenumber-2 sine components rather than from the relatively small cross-beam mean wind components in Danny."	0027-0644		JAN	2011	139	1				153	174		10.1175/2010MWR3036.1

Observations of elevated convection initiation leading to a surface-based squall line during 13 June IHOP_2002	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW									"The evolution of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) observed during the International H(2)O Project that took place on the Great Plains of the United States is described. The MCS formed at night in a frontal zone, with four initiation episodes occurring between approximately 0000 and 0400 local time. Radar, radiosonde, and surface data together show that at least three of the initiation episodes were elevated, occurring from moist conditionally unstable layers located above the boundary layer, which had been stabilized by previous MCSs. Initiation occurred in northwest-southeast-oriented lines where a southerly nocturnal low-level jet terminated, generating elevated convergence. One initiation episode was observed using the S-band dual-polarization Doppler radar (S-Pol) and occurred at the intersection of this convergence zone with a propagating wave. Calculations of the Scorer parameter were consistent with wave trapping. Downdrafts from the developing convection generated both waves and bores, which propagated ahead of the cold pool, initiating further convection. Between 0700 and 1000 local time, the structure and orientation of the MCS evolved to a southwest-northeast-oriented squall line, which built a cold-pool outflow that could lift near-surface air to its level of free convection. The weaker cold pool in the eastern part of the domain was consistent with the greater impacts of a previous MCS there. To the authors' knowledge, this case study provides the first detailed observational investigation of elevated initiation leading to surface-based convection, a process that appears to be an important mechanism for the generation of long-lived MCSs from elevated initiation."	0027-0644		JAN	2011	139	1				247	271		10.1175/2010MWR3422.1

In the current study, radar observations of the 8 May 2003 Oklahoma City tornadic supercell thunderstorm were assimilated into the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Collaborative Model for Multiscale Atmospheric Simulation (NCOMMAS) with an EnKF method. The cloud model employed 1-km horizontal grid spacing, a single-moment bulk precipitation-microphysics scheme, and a base state initialized with sounding data. A 50-member ensemble was produced by randomly perturbing base-state wind profiles and by regularly adding random local perturbations to the horizontal wind, temperature, and water vapor fields in and near observed precipitation. In a reference experiment, only Doppler-velocity observations were assimilated into the NCOMMAS ensemble. Then, radar-reflectivity observations were assimilated together with Doppler-velocity observations in subsequent experiments. Influences that reflectivity observations have on storm-scale analyses were revealed through parameter-space experiments by varying observation availability, observation errors, ensemble spread, and choices for what model variables were updated when a reflectivity observation was assimilated. All experiments produced realistic storm-scale analyses that compared favorably with independent radar observations. Convective storms in the NCOMMAS ensemble developed more quickly when reflectivity observations and velocity observations were both assimilated rather than only velocity, presumably because the EnKF utilized covariances between reflectivity and unobserved model fields such as cloud water and vertical velocity in efficiently developing realistic storm features. Recurring spatial patterns in the differences between predicted and observed reflectivity were noted particularly at low levels, downshear of the supercell's updraft, in the anvil of moderate-to-light precipitation, where reflectivity in the model was typically lower than observed. Bias errors in the predicted rain mixing ratios and/or the size distributions that the bulk scheme associates with these mixing ratios are likely responsible for this reflectivity underprediction. When a reflectivity observation is assimilated, bias errors in the model fields associated with reflectivity (rain, snow, and hail-graupel) can be projected into other model variables through the ensemble covariances. In the current study, temperature analyses in the downshear anvil at low levels, where reflectivity was underpredicted, were very sensitive both to details of the assimilation algorithm and to ensemble spread in temperature. This strong sensitivity suggests low confidence in analyses of low-level cold pools obtained through reflectivity-data assimilation."	0027-0644		JAN	2011	139	1				272	294		10.1175/2010MWR3438.1

Observations from several of the G-V research flights indicate that the vertical velocities in the primary wave exhibited variations up to a factor of 2 between the southern and northern portions of the racetrack flight segments in the lower stratosphere, with the largest amplitude waves most often occurring over the southern flight leg, which has a terrain maximum that is 800 m lower than the northern leg. Multiple racetracks at 11.7- and 13.1-km altitudes indicate that these differences were repeatable, which is suggestive that the deviations were likely due to vertically propagating mountain waves that varied systematically in amplitude rather than associated with transients. The cross-mountain horizontal velocity perturbations are also a maximum above the southern portion of the Sierra Nevada ridge. Real data and idealized nonhydrostatic numerical model simulations are used to test the hypothesis that the observed variability in the wave amplitude and characteristics in the along-barrier direction is a consequence of blocking by the three-dimensional Sierra Nevada and the Coriolis effect. The numerical simulation results suggest that wave launching is sensitive to the overall three-dimensional characteristics of the Sierra Nevada barrier, which has an important impact on the wave amplitude and characteristics in the lower stratosphere. Real-time high-resolution Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) forecasts successfully capture the along-barrier variations in the wave amplitude (using vertical velocity as a proxy) as well as skillfully distinguishing between large- and small-amplitude stratospheric wave events during T-REX."	0027-0644		JAN	2011	139	1				3	23		10.1175/2010MWR3466.1

The twentieth century reanalysis project	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY									"The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century onall time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background 'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.

"Using in situ estimates of ice water content, volume extinction coefficient, and the total solar optical depth obtained during the tropical ACTIVE campaign to test an ensemble model of cirrus ice crystals"	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY									"An ensemble model of cirrus ice crystals combined with a parametrized particle size distribution function (PSD) is used to predict the ice water content (IWC), column-integrated IWC (ice water path, IWP), volume extinction coefficient, and the total solar optical depth, for five tropical cirrus cases. The PSD is estimated from the IWC and in-cloud temperature, and comparisons are presented between the ensemble model predictions and in situ estimates of these microphysical and macrophysical quantities. The in situ estimates were obtained during the Aerosol and Chemical Transport In tropical conVection (ACTIVE) campaign between November-December 2005 and January-February 2006, based at Darwin, Australia. The microphysical instrumentation deployed on the Airborne Australia Egrett research aircraft were the SPEC Cloud Particle Imaging (CPI) probe, Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS) and Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP). The CPI was used to measure ice crystal size from about 5 to 1800 mu m, ice crystal number concentration, and to estimate ice crystal shape, IWC, IWP, volume extinction coefficient and the total solar optical depth. The CIP instrument was also used to measure ice crystal size from about 25 to 1550 mu m, ice crystal number concentration and to estimate IWC. For all flights the limited CPI shape recognition algorithm recorded that about 80% or greater of the ice crystal populations were composed of small irregular or 'quasi-spherical' ice crystals. The CPI- and CIP-estimated IWC distributions are compared against each other and it is shown that the distributions are not significantly different at the 95% level of confidence. The CPI- estimated averaged IWC ranged between approximately 5.3 and 98.2 mg m(-3). The CPI- estimated IWP and total solar optical depth ranged between similar to 1.0 +/- 0.5 and 35.0 +/- 17 g m(-2) and between 0.1 +/- 0.05 and 1.46 +/- 0.73, respectively. To predict the IWC and IWP, an ensemble model effective density-size relationship is derived, and it is shown that the uncertainty in the model predictions are generally within the uncertainty of the CPI estimates for all cases considered. It is also demonstrated that, when the CPI- estimated total solar optical depth is greater than unity, the ensemble model combined with the PSD scheme predicts an uncertainty in the volume extinction coefficient and total solar optical depth that is within the CPI experimental range of uncertainty. However, for total solar optical depths much less than unity, the ensemble model combined with the PSD scheme does not generally predict an uncertainty in the volume extinction coefficient and total solar optical depth that is within the lower range of the CPI uncertainty; the physical reason for this is further explored. The paper demonstrates that there is predictive value in combining an ensemble model of ice crystals with a universal PSD scheme to predict the microphysical and macrophysical properties of importance to radiative transfer through tropical cirrus. Moreover, in the case of very low IWC tropical cirrus, further characterization of the PSD is required using a number of in situ instruments.

A review of the anthropogenic influence on biogenic secondary organic aerosol	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Because of the climate and air quality effects of organic aerosol, it is important to quantify the influence of anthropogenic emissions on the aerosol burden, both globally and regionally, and both in terms of mass and number. Methods exist with which the fractions of organic aerosol resulting directly from anthropogenic and biogenic processes can be estimated. However, anthropogenic emissions can also lead to an enhancement in secondary organic aerosol formation from naturally emitted precursors. We term this enhanced biogenic secondary organic aerosol (eBSOA). Here, we review the mechanisms through which such an effect may occur in the atmosphere and describe a work flow via which it may be quantified, using existing measurement techniques. An examination of published data reveals support for the existence of the enhancement effect."	1680-7316			2011	11	1				321	343		10.5194/acp-11-321-2011

Mesoscale processes for super heavy rainfall of Typhoon Morakot (2009) over Southern Taiwan	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS									"Within 100 h, a record-breaking rainfall, 2855 mm, was brought to Taiwan by typhoon Morakot in August 2009 resulting in devastating landslides and casualties. Analyses and simulations show that under favorable large-scale situations, this unprecedented precipitation was caused first by the convergence of the southerly component of the pre-existing strong southwesterly monsoonal flow and the northerly component of the typhoon circulation. Then the westerly component of southwesterly flow pushed the highly moist air (mean specific humidity > 16 g/kg between 950 and 700 hPa from NCEP GFS data set) eastward against the Central Mountain Range, and forced it to lift in the preferred area. From the fine-scale numerical simulation, not only did the convergence itself provide the source of the heavy rainfall when it interacted with the topography, but also convective cells existed within the typhoon's main rainband. The convective cells were in the form of small rainbands perpendicular to the main one, and propagated as wave trains downwind. As the main rainband moved northward and reached the southern CMR, convective cells inside the narrow convergence zone to the south and those to the north as wave trains, both rained heavily as they were lifted by the west-facing mountain slopes. Those mesoscale processes were responsible for the unprecedented heavy rainfall total that accompanied this typhoon."	1680-7316			2011	11	1				345	361		10.5194/acp-11-345-2011

This method is fully two-dimensional so that it may be easily implemented on non-cartesian grids such as the cubed-sphere grid. We present a flux-form implementation, FF-CSLAM, which retains the advantages of CSLAM while also allowing the use of flux-limited monotonicity and positivity preservation and efficient tracer sub-cycling. The methods are equivalent in the absence of Flux limiting or reconstruction filtering. FF-CSLAM was found to be third-order accurate when an appropriately smooth initial mass distribution and flow field (with at least a continuous second derivative) was used. This was true even when using highly deformational Flows and when the distribution is advected over the singularities in the cubed sphere, the latter a consequence of the full two-dimensionality of the method. Flux-limited monotonicity preservation, which is only available in a Flux-form method, was found to be both less diffusive and more efficient than the monotone reconstruction filtering available to CSLAM. Despite the additional overhead of computing fluxes compared to CSLAM's cell integrations, the non-monotone FF-CSLAM was found to be at most only 40% slower than CSLAM for Courant numbers less than one, with greater overhead for successively larger Courant numbers.

A low communication and large time step explicit finite-volume solver for non-hydrostatic atmospheric dynamics	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA									"An explicit finite-volume solver is proposed for numerical simulation of non-hydrostatic atmospheric dynamics with promise for efficiency on massively parallel machines via low communication needs and large time steps. Solving the governing equations with a single stage lowers communication, and using the method of characteristics to follow information as it propagates enables large time steps. Using a non-oscillatory interpolant, the method is stable without post-hoc filtering. Characteristic variables (built from interface flux vectors) are integrated upstream from interfaces along their trajectories to compute time-averaged fluxes over a time step. Thus we call this method a Flux-Based Characteristic Semi-Lagrangian (FBCSL) method. Multidimensionality is achieved via a second-order accurate Strang operator splitting. Spatial accuracy is achieved via the third- to fifth-order accurate Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) interpolant. We implement the theory to form a 2-D non-hydrostatic compressible (Euler system) atmospheric model in which standard test cases confirm accuracy and stability. We maintain stability with time steps larger than CFL = 1 (CFL number determined by the acoustic wave speed, not advection) but note that accuracy degrades unacceptably for most cases with CFL > 2. For the smoothest test case, we ran out to CFL = 7 to investigate the error associated with simulation at large CFL number time steps. Analysis suggests improvement of trajectory computations will improve error for large CFL numbers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of chemistry-dependent artifacts on gravimetric PM fine readings at the T1 site during the MILAGRO field campaign	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT									"As part of the MIRAGE (MILAGRO) study conducted 7-30 March 2006 in Mexico City and its Metropolitan Area (MCMA), fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) was collected using two Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) systems, and a Partisol instrument at the T1 super-site (Tecamac, State of Mexico). Inorganic analysis was performed on filter-based (PM(1), PM(2.5)-URG) measurements also collected at this site. Measurements from the gravimetric (TEOMs, Partisol) and URG systems were inter-compared with chemical speciation measurements using a Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) and Thermal Optical methods. Mass and chemical balances applied over the first part of the study (11-22 March) showed that a TEOM using a device (SES) which reduces particle-bound water and retains a fraction of semi-volatile compounds (SVM) gives readings similar to 30% larger than a conventional TEOM. In the second part of the study (26-30 March), the loss of SVM during TEOM-heated filter collection (both systems) represented a significant fraction of PM(2.5) mass due to changes in particle composition. Overall, when nonvolatile nitrate dominated (i.e., when associated with crustal species and not NH(4)(+)) and/or sulfate dominates (SO(4)(2-)/NO(3)(-) molar ratio is >1), PM(2.5) mass readings are in agreement with those reported for the T1 site if TEOM is using a SES device. However, when volatile nitrate dominates (i.e., NH(4)NO(3)) or SO(4)(2-)/NO(3)(-) molar ratio is <1, a larger fraction is lost from both TEOMs (with or without the SES device). Under the latter regime, uncertainties are large and gravimetric losses may reach 30%-50%. The gravimetric PARTISOL instrument recorded lower readings under all of the aforementioned conditions with differences versus TEOMs decreasing with increasing RH. These findings call for a careful characterization of such volatilization biases to improve current PM (PM(10). PM(2.5)) measurements/networks, especially in alkaline-rich environments that can favor such biases. With regards to PM(1) and PM(2.5) filter-based measurements, findings are: 1) crustal-related elements are important features in the PM(2.5-1) size fraction; 2) a factor of similar to 2 overestimation of SO(4)(2-) concentrations is recorded on substrates during PM collection and 3) main elements of a typical urban aerosol size distribution are concentrated in the 1 mu m (versus 2.5 mu m) size fraction.

Mid-latitude ozone is expected to return to 1980 levels before mid-century, slightly earlier than predicted previously. However, the recovery rate will be slower at high latitudes. Springtime ozone depletion is expected to continue to occur at polar latitudes, especially in Antarctica, in the next few decades. Because of the success of the Protocol, increases in UV-B radiation have been small outside regions affected by the Antarctic ozone hole, and have been difficult to detect. There is a large variability in UV-B radiation due to factors other than ozone, such as clouds and aerosols. There are few long-term measurements available to confirm the increases that would have occurred as a result of ozone depletion. At mid-latitudes UV-B irradiances are currently only slightly greater than in 1980 (increases less than similar to 5%), but increases have been substantial at high and polar latitudes where ozone depletion has been larger. Without the Montreal Protocol, peak values of sunburning UV radiation could have been tripled by 2065 at mid-northern latitudes. This would have had serious consequences for the environment and for human health. There are strong interactions between ozone depletion and changes in climate induced by increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Ozone depletion affects climate, and climate change affects ozone. The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has had a marked effect on climate change. The calculated reduction in radiative forcing due to the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) far exceeds that from the measures taken under the Kyoto protocol for the reduction of GHGs. Thus the phase-out of CFCs is currently tending to counteract the increases in surface temperature due to increased GHGs. The amount of stratospheric ozone can also be affected by the increases in the concentration of GHGs, which lead to decreased temperatures in the stratosphere and accelerated circulation patterns. These changes tend to decrease total ozone in the tropics and increase total ozone at mid and high latitudes. Changes in circulation induced by changes in ozone can also affect patterns of surface wind and rainfall. The projected changes in ozone and clouds may lead to large decreases in UV at high latitudes, where UV is already low; and to small increases at low latitudes, where it is already high. This could have important implications for health and ecosystems. Compared to 1980, UV-B irradiance towards the end of the 21st century is projected to be lower at mid to high latitudes by between 5 and 20% respectively, and higher by 2-3% in the low latitudes. However, these projections must be treated with caution because they also depend strongly on changes in cloud cover, air pollutants, and aerosols, all of which are influenced by climate change, and their future is uncertain. Strong interactions between ozone depletion and climate change and uncertainties in the measurements and models limit our confidence in predicting the future UV radiation. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of the processes involved, and to continue monitoring ozone and surface UV spectral irradiances both from the surface and from satellites so we can respond to unexpected changes in the future."	1474-905X			2011	10	2				182	198		10.1039/c0pp90034f

Changes in air quality and tropospheric composition due to depletion of stratospheric ozone and interactions with climate	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES									"Air pollution will be directly influenced by future changes in emissions of pollutants, climate, and stratospheric ozone, and will have significant consequences for human health and the environment. UV radiation is one of the controlling factors for the formation of photochemical smog, which includes tropospheric ozone (O(3)) and aerosols; it also initiates the production of hydroxyl radicals (SOH), which control the amount of many climate-and ozone-relevant gases (e. g., methane and HCFCs) in the atmosphere. Numerical models predict that future changes in UV radiation and climate will modify the trends and geographic distribution of SOH, thus affecting the formation of photochemical smog in many urban and regional areas. Concentrations of SOH are predicted to decrease globally by an average of 20% by 2100, with local concentrations varying by as much as a factor of two above and below current values. However, significant differences between modelled and measured values in a limited number of case studies show that chemistry of hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere is not fully understood. Photochemically produced tropospheric ozone is projected to increase. If emissions of anthropogenic air pollutants from combustion of fossil fuels, burning of biomass, and agricultural activities continue to increase, concentrations of tropospheric O(3) will tend to increase over the next 20-40 years in certain regions of low and middle latitudes because of interactions of emissions, chemical processes, and climate change. Climate-driven increases in temperature and humidity will also increase production of tropospheric O(3) in polluted regions, but reduce it in more pristine regions. Higher temperatures tend to increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) from some soils and release of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vegetation, leading to greater background concentrations of ozone in the troposphere. The net effects of future changes in UV radiation, meteorological conditions, and anthropogenic emissions may be large, thus posing challenges for prediction and management of air quality. Aerosols composed of organic substances have a major role in both climate and air quality, and contribute a large uncertainty to the energy budget of the atmosphere. These aerosols are mostly formed via the UV-initiated oxidation of VOCs from anthropogenic and biogenic sources, although the details of the chemistry are still poorly understood and current models under-predict their abundance. A better understanding of their formation, chemical composition, and optical properties is required to assess their significance for air quality and to better quantify their direct and indirect radiative forcing of climate. Emissions of compounds containing fluorine will continue to have effects on the chemistry of the atmosphere and on climate change. The HCFCs and HFCs used as substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs can break down into trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which will accumulate in oceans, salt lakes, and playas. Based on historical use and projections of future uses, including new products entering the market, such as the fluoro-olefins, increased loadings of TFA in these environmental sinks will be small. Even when added to existing amounts from natural sources, risks to humans or the environment from the historical use of CFCs or continued use of their replacements is judged to be negligible."	1474-905X			2011	10	2				280	291		10.1039/c0pp90039g

On the determination of age of air trends from atmospheric trace species	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES									"Trace chemical species have been used in numerical models to calculate the age of air (AOA), which is a measure of the strength of the mean meridional circulation. The trend in the AOA has also been computed and found to be negative in simulations where greenhouse gases increase with time, which is consistent with the acceleration of the mean meridional circulation calculated under these conditions. This modeling result has been tested recently using observations of SF(6), a very long lived species whose atmospheric concentration has increased rapidly over the last half century, and of CO(2), which is also very long lived and increasing with time. Surprisingly, the AOA estimated from these gases exhibits no significant trend over the period 1975-2005. Here the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is used to derive estimates of the AOA from SF(6) and CO(2) over the period 1965-2006. The calculated AOA yields trends that are smaller than the trend derived from a synthetic, linearly growing tracer, even after accounting for the nonlinear growth rates of SF(6) and CO(2). A simplified global transport model and analytical arguments are used to show that this follows from the variable growth rate of these species. It is also shown that, when AOA is sampled sparsely as in the observations, the resulting trends have very large error bars and are statistically undistinguishable from zero. These results suggest that trends in the AOA are difficult to estimate unambiguously except for well-sampled tracers that increase linearly and uniformly. While such tracers can be defined in numerical models, there are no naturally occurring species that exhibit such idealized behavior."	0022-4928		JAN	2011	68	1				139	154		10.1175/2010JAS3527.1

The model has three nested domains with the grid spacing of 18, 6 and 2 km. To evaluate the simulations of winter orographic clouds and precipitation, comparisons are made between model simulations and observations to determine how the model simulates the cloud distribution, cloud height, cloud vertical profiles and snow precipitation. The simulated results of the 02:00 UTC cycling with 2-km resolution are used in the comparison. The observations include SNOTEL, ceilometer, sounding and satellite data, from the ground to air. The verification of these observations indicates that the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) RT-FDDA system provides good simulations. It is better to use data within the forecast period of 2-16 h simulations. Although the horizontal wind component near the ground has some bias, and the simulated clouds are a little higher and have a little more coverage than observed, the simulated precipitation is a little weaker than observed. The results of the comparison show that the WRF RT-FDDA model provides good simulations and can be used in orographic cloud seeding."	1001-6538		JAN	2011	56	1				76	83		10.1007/s11434-010-4249-2

Influences from the extra-tropics through the lateral boundaries have been found to be essential to the reproduction of the initiation of certain MJO events. This led to a hypothesis that multi-year simulations using a tropical channel model would reproduce reasonable MJO statistics under the influence of prescribed lateral boundary conditions derived from global reanalyses. Interestingly, the MJO statistics in such a multi-year simulation by a high-resolution tropical channel model are not better than those from global climate models. The error in the atmospheric mean state is found to be a possible reason for the poor MJO statistics in the simulation. Nevertheless, even with a large error in the mean state, the multi-year simulation captures two MJO events previously found to be initiated by exiratropical influences. However, the model does not reproduce a third event, whose initiation is not directly influenced by the extratropics. This implies that in the absence of dynamical interactions between the MJO and the lateral boundary conditions, the error in the mean state could be sufficient to prevent the MJO initiation. To explore this third MJO event further, a series of sensitiviiy tests are conducted. These tests show that the simulation of this event is neither critically influenced by the cumulus parameterization employed, nor the initial conditions when the model is integrated 2 weeks prior to the MJO initiation. The model captures this event when the MJO signal is already present in the initial conditions. The use of high-resolution sea surface temperature does not improve the simulation of the third MJO event. A higher-resolution nested domain covering the Indo-Pacific warm pool region and including a cloud-system resolving domain over the Indonesian Maritime Continent has little effect on the WO initiation over the Indian Ocean. In <2 weeks the error in the simulation is comparable to the climate error. The role of the simulated MJO on the mean state is also explored. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed."	0930-7575		JAN	2011	36	1-2				161	184		10.1007/s00382-010-0859-2

Development and testing of polar WRF. Part III: Arctic land	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE									"A version of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) has been developed for use in polar climates. The model known as ""Polar WRF"" is tested for land areas with a western Arctic grid that has 25-km resolution. This work serves as preparation for the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis of the years 2000-10. The model is based upon WRF version 3.0.1.1, with improvements to the Noah land surface model and snow/ice treatment. Simulations consist of a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC, with the initial 24 h taken as spinup for atmospheric hydrology and boundary layer processes. Soil temperature and moisture that have a much slower spinup than the atmosphere are cycled from 48-h output of earlier runs. Arctic conditions are simulated for a winter-to-summer seasonal cycle from 15 November 2006 to 1 August 2007. Simulation results are compared with a variety of observations from several Alaskan sites, with emphasis on the North Slope. Polar WRF simulation results show good agreement with most near-surface observations. Warm temperature biases are found for winter and summer. A sensitivity experiment with reduced soil heat conductivity, however, improves simulation of near-surface temperature, ground heat flux, and soil temperature during winter. There is a marked deficit in summer cloud cover over land with excessive incident shortwave radiation. The cloud deficit may result from anomalous vertical mixing of moisture by the turbulence parameterization. The new snow albedo parameterization for WRF 3.1.1 is successfully tested for snowmelt over the North Slope of Alaska."	0894-8755		JAN	2011	24	1				26	48		10.1175/2010JCLI3460.1

Explosive erosion during the Phoenix landing exposes subsurface water on Mars	ICARUS									"While steady thruster jets caused only modest surface erosion during previous spacecraft landings on the Moon and Mars, the pulsed jets from the Phoenix spacecraft led to extensive alteration of its landing site on the martian arctic, exposed a large fraction of the subsurface water ice under the lander, and led to the discovery of evidence for liquid saline water on Mars. Here we report the discovery of the 'explosive erosion' process that led to this extensive erosion. We show that the impingement of supersonic pulsed jets fluidizes porous soils and forms cyclic shock waves which propagate through the soil and produce erosion rates more than an order of magnitude larger than that of other jet-induced processes. The understanding of 'explosive erosion' allows the calculation of bulk physical properties of the soils altered by it, provides insight into a new behavior of granular flow at extreme conditions and explains the rapid alteration of the Phoenix landing site's ground morphology at the northern arctic plains of Mars.

Unary and binary heterogeneous nucleation of organic vapors on monodisperse WO(x) seed particles with diameters down to 1.4 nm	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY									"Unary and binary heterogeneous nucleation has been studied experimentally using monodisperse tungsten oxide (WO(x)) particles in the size range from 1.4 nm up to 7 nm.

The experiments were performed with an expansion-type condensation particle counter in combination with a constant-angle Mie scattering detector providing counting efficiency of 100% down to at least 3 nm particle diameter. The binary n-propanol-n-nonane system was found to co-nucleate only reluctantly which is in agreement with homogeneous nucleation experiments as well as composition of critical clusters as determined by the heterogeneous nucleation theorem.

Interest in these two wave modes stems from their potential predictability out to several weeks in advance, as well as a strong observed linkage between easterly waves and tropical cyclogenesis. The model is a recent version of the weather research and forecast (WRF) system with 36-km horizontal grid spacing and convection parameterized using a scheme that accounts for key convective triggering and inhibition processes. The domain spans the entire tropical belt between 45 degrees S and 45 degrees N with periodic boundary conditions in the east west direction, and conditions at the meridional/lower boundaries specified based on observations. The simulation covers 6 years from 2000 to 2005, which is long enough to establish a statistical depiction of the waves through space-time spectral filtering of rainfall data, together with simple lagged-linear regression. Results show that both the horizontal phase speeds and three-dimensional structures of the waves are qualitatively well captured by the model in comparison to observations. However, significant biases in wave activity are seen, with generally overactive easterly waves and underactive Kelvin waves. Evidence is presented to suggest that these biases in wave activity (which are also correlated with biases in time mean rainfall, as well as biases in the model's tropical cyclone climatology) stem in part from convection in the model coupling too strongly to rotational circulation anomalies. Nevertheless, the model is seen to do a reasonable job at capturing the genesis of tropical cyclones from easterly waves, with evidence for both wave accumulation and critical layer processes being importantly involved."	0930-7575		JAN	2011	36	1-2				185	203		10.1007/s00382-009-0697-2

We also investigate uncertainties originating from the stochastic nature of the oscillations. Methods. For this investigation we use Kepler data obtained during the first four months of operation. These data have been analysed by different groups using already published methods and the results are compared. We also performed simulations to investigate the uncertainty on the resulting parameters due to different realizations of the stochastic signal. Results. We obtain results for the frequency of maximum oscillation power (nu(max)) and the mean large separation (<Delta nu >) from different methods for over one thousand red-giant stars. The results for these parameters agree within a few percent and seem therefore robust to the different analysis methods and definitions used here.

Convective forcing	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY									"We present results from numerical simulations of the interaction of internal gravity waves (IGW) with magnetic fields in the radiative interior of the Sun. In this second paper, the waves are forced self-consistently by an overlying convection zone and a toroidal magnetic field is imposed in the stably stratified layer just underneath the convection zone. Consistent with the results of previous analytic and simple numerical calculations, we find a strong wave-field interaction, in which waves are reflected in the field region. The wave-field interaction and wave reflection depend on the field strength as well as on the adopted values of the diffusivities. In some cases, wave reflection leads to an increased mean flow in the field region. In addition to reproducing some of the features of our simpler models, we find additional complex behaviours in these more complete and realistic calculations. First, we find that the spectrum of wave generation, both in magnetized and in unmagnetized models, is not generally well described by available analytic models, although some overlap does exist. Similarly, we find that the dissipation of waves is only partially described by the results of linear theory. We find that the distortion of the field by waves and convective overshoot leads to rapid decay and entrainment of the magnetic field which subsequently changes the wave-field interaction. In addition, the field alters the amount of wave energy propagating into the deep radiative interior, at times increasing the wave energy there and at others decreasing it. Because of the complexity of the problem and because the durations of these simulations are shorter than the anticipated time-scale for dynamical adjustment of the deep solar interior, we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the deep radiative interior by IGW in the presence of a magnetic field."	0035-8711		JAN	2011	410	2				946	962		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17493.x

As a polarimeter, IMaX uses fast polarization modulation (based on the use of two liquid crystal retarders), real-time image accumulation, and dual-beam polarimetry to reach polarization sensitivities of 0.1%. As a spectrograph, the instrument uses a LiNbO(3) etalon in double pass and a narrow band pre-filter to achieve a spectral resolution of 85 m. IMaX uses the high-Zeeman-sensitive line of Fe i at 5250.2 and observes all four Stokes parameters at various points inside the spectral line. This allows vector magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and intensity frames to be produced that, after reconstruction, reach spatial resolutions in the 0.15 -aEuro parts per thousand 0.18 arcsec range over a 50x50 arcsec field of view. Time cadences vary between 10 and 33 s, although the shortest one only includes longitudinal polarimetry. The spectral line is sampled in various ways depending on the applied observing mode, from just two points inside the line to 11 of them. All observing modes include one extra wavelength point in the nearby continuum. Gauss equivalent sensitivities are 4 G for longitudinal fields and 80 G for transverse fields per wavelength sample.
