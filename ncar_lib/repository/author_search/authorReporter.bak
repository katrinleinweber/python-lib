"""
Goal: find all refs in OpenSky (NCAR Library DCS) that a particular person (e.g., "Phil Judge") has contributed to

produce a report of the following fields: record #, title, collection, and status. 
sorted on title (but of course, this could be done in spreadsheet).

Challenge: we have to look across both 'osm' and 'citation' frameworks (any others?).

Approach: start with repository.
- search for all records with an author with same LASTNAME

categories of matches (in order of trustworthiness):
	- matching upid number
	- Matching lastname, firstinitial, lastinitial
	- matching lastname
