"""
this package will use a "repository walker" that traverses the repository structure,
visiting collections and performing an operation on that collection (e.g., filter by framework),
as well as operations on metadata (e.g., updateCopyright()).

We can see what the context is at this point or when we need to implement an operation
that could use to one of the objects thus far created (e.g., the walker itself) without having to
pass them along as references. (maybe not so important, but interesting just to see the stack).

Anyhoo, below is a list of tasks that we want to accomplish. Most/all can be written as operations
on osm_metadata_records.
 


Tasks:
1. On submission form, stop writing values for /record/resources/relation/@type
(DONE!)

2. Update /record/resources/relation/@type = "Has image" records:
	
	a. For each entry, move the contents of /record/resources/relation/@title and
@description to a new /record/resource/description field. The description field
should have the title content, then a colon followed by description content. If
there is only description content and no title content, skip the title content
and colon.

3. Update /record/resources/relation/@type = "Is published" , "Is referenced
by", "Is related", "Is replaced by", "References", "Unknown" records: 

a. For each entry, delete the contents of /record/resources/relation/@type and
remove the attribute because it is optional.

4. For FY2011, provide a list for missing assets on refereed publications. So if
/record/classify/classification = "Refereed" and /record/coverage/fiscalYear =
"2011" and /record/resources/primaryAsset/@url is blank, then create a that
includes: 
	1) record id, 
	2) title, 
	3)all authors, 
	4) UCAR authors and their divisions.

5. Update /record/rights/copyrightNotice/@type = "Public domain", "Publisher",
"UCAR Open Access Policy", "UCAR Ownership", "Unknown".

a. For each entry, delete the contents of /record/rights/copyrightNotice/@type and remove the
attribute because it is optional.

6. Update /record/rights/copyrightNotice when /record/general/title/@type =
"Presentation/webcast" or "Poster" or "Newsletter"  

a. For each entry, make the contents of /record/rights/copyrightNotice be: 

	 Copyright. All rights reserved. University Corporation for Atmospheric
	 Research (UCAR). The user is granted the right to use this resource for
	 non-commercial, non-profit research, or educational purposes only, as are
	 more fully described in the NCAR Library Terms of Use.

b. For each entry, make the contents of 
	/record/rights/copyrightNotice/@URL
	be:
	http://www.ucar.edu/legal/terms_of_use.shtml

7. Update /record/rights/copyrightNotice when /record/general/title/@type =
"Interactive resource"

a. For each entry, make the contents of
/record/rights/copyrightNotice
be: 

	Please consult the resource directly for copyright information.

8. After the updates to the type fields on relation and copyrightNotice, then
Katy's updates these vocabs to be the smaller number of agreed upon terms.
