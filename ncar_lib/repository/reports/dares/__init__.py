Problem Statement (Jamaica):
	
One of Tim Hoar's essential needs is to be able to generate a list of
publications that can be associated with his program, DAReS. Currently, very few
are properly attributed, and I'm wondering if you can help me programmatically
insert the correct metadata.

Process - Depends on Dares author classification - see DaresAuthors
