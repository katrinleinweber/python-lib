Realistic uses of these skills require their application with the higher-level thinking skills of reasoning and problem solving. Further proficiency in mathematics requires fluency in mental mathematics and employment of technology. Students must master the discipline of mathematics and apply that discipline to a variety of complex tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Problem-solving has been integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills should be a major goal of the mathematics program in every strand at every grade level. Instruction in the process of problem solving will need to be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education. Students must be helped to develop a wide range of skills and strategies for solving problems.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D1000230</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>NC</author><topic>science</topic><filename>Science-2004-North Carolina-Science Standard Course of Study an.xml</filename><title>Science Standard Course of Study and Grade Level Competencies</title><description>The science component of the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (SCS) was created to ensure such an

The Sunshine State Standards are divided into five strands categorizing broad areas of knowledge within language arts. This division does not mean that learning should be fragmented. The language arts strands and expectations are interdependent. In fact, several expectations might often be combined in a single teaching or assessment activity. Further, when used effectively, instructional activities will include grade level expectations from other language arts strands and from other subjects. Research indicates that learning is most effective when new information is related to previous knowledge and has some immediate application in the life of the learner.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1996</created><docId>D1000062</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>CT</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-1998-Connecticut-Arts Curriculum Framework.xml</filename><title>Connecticut Arts Curriculum Framework</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1998</created><docId>D10002F7</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>NC</author><topic>math</topic><filename>Math-2003-North Carolina-Standard Course of Study and Grade .xml</filename><title>Standard Course of Study and Grade Level Indicator</title><description>The intent of the North Carolina Mathematics Standard Course of Study is to provide a set of mathematical competencies for each grade and high school course to ensure rigorous student academic performance standards that are uniform across the state.

Mathematics, when taught well, is a subject of beauty and elegance, exciting in its logic and coherence. It trains the mind to be analytic—providing the foundation for intelligent and precise thinking. To compete successfully in the worldwide economy, today’s students must have a high degree of comprehension in mathematics. For too long schools have suffered from the notion that success in mathematics is the province of a talented few. Instead, a new expectation is needed: all students will attain California’s mathematics academic content standards, and many will be inspired to achieve far beyond the minimum standards.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1997</created><docId>D100011F</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>SC</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2007-South Carolina-Academic Standards for English Lang.xml</filename><title>South Carolina Academic Standards for English Language Arts</title><description>The South Carolina English Language Arts Academic Standards 2007 contains the revised academic standards in English language arts for South Carolina students from kindergarten through English 4.

The Language Arts Content Standards emphasize reading, writing, oral communication, and the study of literature and language from the earliest
grades to graduation. They establish a foundation upon which to develop an effective literacy program. They provide direction for curriculum and
require the best teaching practices. They are, however, not an end but a beginning—a starting point for discussion about curriculum, instruction, and

GSEs are meant to capture the “big ideas” of civics and history that can be taught and assessed, without narrowing the curriculum locally. They are not intended to represent the full curriculum for instruction and assessment locally, nor are they meant to simply replace existing social studies curriculum. The set of GSEs includes concepts and skills intended to be for local assessment purposes only. Generally speaking, Grade Span Expectations – at any grade – represent content knowledge and skills that have been introduced instructionally at least one to two years before students are expected to demonstrate confidence in applying them independently.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2008</created><docId>D100038F</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>TN</author><topic>math</topic><filename>Math-2004-Tennessee-Mathematics Courses 9 - 12.xml</filename><title>Tennessee Mathematics Courses 9 - 12</title><description>&quot;Mathematical Connections&quot; concentrate on enabling the learners to:

A Task Force from the Course of Study Committee has separated the reading standards from the remainder of the course of study standards.  Although these reading standards are based on the course of study, some differences exist between the course of study content and the content of the revised reading standards.

A performance standard has four components: a content standard, illustrative tasks, examples of student work, and a commentary for teachers. Together, these components will be the teacher’s guide as to what to teach, how thoroughly to treat a topic, and what some instances of student work that meet the content standard might look like. The Georgia performance standards for mathematics have been designed to achieve a balance among concepts, skills, and problem solving.

This will prepare students to weigh both short-term and long-term effects of decisions as well as possible unintended consequences. The study of economics explains historical developments and patterns, the results of trade, and the distribution of income and wealth in local, regional, national, and world economies.

provides a very unique perspective of the world, they should not be taught in isolation. Social Studies is by its very nature integrative. The
important social issues require insights from across the disciplines. Citizenship, civics/government, economics, geography and history each offer
distinct approaches and develop specific skills for examining common subject matter, which can be integrated when addressing a particular issue

Knowledge and skills that students acquire through fine arts instruction include the abilities to think critically, solve problems creatively, make informed judgments, work cooperatively within groups, appreciate different cultures, imagine, and create.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D100031B</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>KY</author><topic>socialStudies</topic><filename>Social Studies-2006-Kentucky-Program of Studies Social Studies.xml</filename><title>Program of Studies Social Studies Revised 2006</title><description>The primary purpose of social studies is to help students develop the ability to make informed decisions as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world. The skills and concepts found throughout this document reflect this purpose by promoting the belief that students must develop more than an understanding of social studies content. They must also be able to apply the content perspectives of several academic fields of the social studies to personal and public experiences. By stressing the importance of both content knowledge and its application, the social studies curriculum in Kentucky provides a framework that prepares students to become productive citizens.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D10002CC</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>KY</author><topic>socialStudies</topic><filename>Social Studies-2006-Kentucky-Core Content for Social Studies.xml</filename><title>Core Content for Social Studies Assessment Version 4.1</title><description>The Core Content for Assessment 4.1 (CCA 4.1) is a subset of the content standards in Kentucky’s Program of Studies for Grades Primary – 12.

Content standards describe what students need to know and be able to do at each grade level. In Nevada, these content standards are considered the floor, not the ceiling, for student learning and performance. This document serves as a framework to guide districts in creating their curriculum based on the state standards. It is essential that the content standards are not taught in isolation; rather, multiple standards are taught within a single lesson ensuring teachers, students, and parents make the connections between reading and writing to enhance performance.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2007</created><docId>D1000330</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MA</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2001-Massachusetts-English Language Arts Curriculum Fr.xml</filename><title>Massachusetts English Language Arts Curriculum Framework</title><description>This framework is designed to guide local school district personnel in the development of effective English language arts curricula. It is based on two important concepts. First, learning in English language arts is recursive. That is, students at every grade level apply similar language skills and concepts as they use increasingly more complex materials. In this way, students build upon and refine their knowledge, gaining sophistication and independence as they grow. Second, although represented separately in the framework, the strands—Language, Reading and Literature, Composition, and Media—are, in fact, interdependent. Each strand intertwines with and supports the others. Students might at any time read and write, view and discuss, or interpret and perform in order to understand and communicate meaning. Thus, at all grade levels, effective English language arts curriculum units weave together skills and concepts from several strands to support student learning.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2001</created><docId>D100011C</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MI</author><topic>health</topic><filename>Health-2007-Michigan-K-8 Grade Level Content Expectation.xml</filename><title>K-8 Grade Level Content Expectations for Health Education</title><description>The Michigan Department of Education has developed Grade Level Content Expectations (GLCE) in Health Education for K-8 with the help of 155 teachers, parents, health content experts, and others interested in the health and learning of Michigan's children.

However, the guiding philosophy of this document is that the five content standards should be taught in an integrated manner, not in isolation. Woven into the content standards are the processes of problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections, and representation. These five process standards, forged with the five content standards, communicate a vision of mathematical literacy which goes beyond traditional mathematics skills.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2001</created><docId>D1000032</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>TX</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-1998-Texas-TEKS ELA Amended 2008.xml</filename><title>Chapter 110.

The content of the framework is centered on the areas of reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, research, and inquiry. In teaching each of these key areas of the language arts curriculum, teachers should work to ensure students are actively engaged in meaningful activities that emphasize the importance of language arts in daily life; enhance students’ confidence in their ability to read, write, speak, listen, view, and conduct research; and help students learn to communicate and reason more effectively. The framework provides teachers with a guide to assist in instructing students with the essential language arts concepts students should learn as they pursue a career or continue their education.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000246</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>TN</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2006-Tennessee-Dance Curriculum Standards.xml</filename><title>Dance Curriculum Standards</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000325</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>TN</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2006-Tennessee-Theatre Curriculum Standards.xml</filename><title>Theatre Curriculum Standards</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000327</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>TN</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2006-Tennessee-Music Curriculum Standards.xml</filename><title>Music Curriculum Standards</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000326</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>PA</author><topic>geography</topic><filename>Geography-2003-Pennsylvania-Academic Standards for Geography.xml</filename><title>Academic Standards for Geography</title><description>The Geography Standards describe what students should know and be able to do at four grade levels (third, sixth, ninth and twelfth).

They are not intended to represent the full science curriculum at each grade span, but are meant to capture the “major ideas” of science that can be assessed in an on-demand setting. The goal is that the science GSEs focus the curriculum, but do not restrict it. The science GSEs are written for grade spans K-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and high school. They describe the science knowledge and abilities students should demonstrate at the end of each grade span.

Each standard describes the content students need to master by the end of each grade level (kindergarten through grade eight) or cluster of grade levels (grades nine and ten and grades eleven and twelve). In accordance with Education Code Section 60603, as added by Assembly Bill 265 (Chapter 975, Statutes of 1995), the Leroy Greene California Assessment of Academic Achievement Act, there will be performance standards that “define various levels of competence at each grade level . . .

At the K-6 level, it is the expectation that students are given broad-based exposure through instruction as well as opportunities for participation in each of the four arts forms. In grades 7-8, they should gain greater depth of understanding in at least one of those disciplines. In grades 9-12, it is the expectation that students demonstrate competency in at least one arts discipline. The state arts standards also reflect the same expectations as those stated in the National Standards for Arts Education (1994). The revised arts standards assist educators in delineating the required knowledge and expected behaviors in all four
of the arts disciplines. This format reflects the critical importance of locating the separate arts disciplines as one common body of knowledge and skills.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D10002FC</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MS</author><topic>science</topic><filename>Science-2008-Mississippi-2010 Mississippi Science Framework.xml</filename><title>2010 Mississippi Science Framework</title><description>The primary purpose of the 2010 Mississippi Science Framework is to provide a basis for curriculum development for K-12 teachers.

The content of the framework is centered on the strands of inquiry, physical science, life science, and Earth and space science. Instruction in these areas is designed to expose students to experiences which reflect how science should be valued, to enhance students’ confidence in their ability to apply scientific processes, and to help students learn to communicate and reason scientifically. The 2010 Mississippi Science Framework provides teachers with the systematic progression across grade levels and is written to ensure the development of essential science concepts that students will utilize as they pursue a career or continue their education.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2008</created><docId>D100036D</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>WI</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-1997-Wisconsin-Model Academic Standards for Dance.xml</filename><title>Wisconsin's Model Academic Standards for Dance</title><description>Dance education begins with an awareness of the movement of the body and draws upon the same resources as movement used in everyday life.

However, the pure content of theatre is what is taught in history, language arts, science, and mathematics. What is unique to theatre is its active form. The standards also teach broader learning concepts. The skills of critical thinking, problem-solving, working with others, communication skills, and decision making are integral to every element of theatre and carry over into all of the other subject areas.

Understandings of commerce and geography were critical to their thinking as well. In essence, Jefferson, Mann, and Dewey viewed the study of social studies as critical to the mission of public schools.

In December 2003, the State Board of Education adopted these standards, an important step in the creation of a seamless P-12 education system.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D1000352</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>AZ</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2006-Arizona-Theatre Standards.xml</filename><title>Arizona Theatre Standards</title><description>The goal of the committee was to restructure the original standards so that they were organized in such a way as to accommodate the varied entry points of students into the discipline. Hence, the standards are not organized by grade level. District curriculums will provide an opportunity for students to fulfill Beginning through Advanced Performance Objectives by the twelfth grade. The committee structured the standards in a way so that any grade level/content area could pursue a goal of proficiency for their students. The idea being that students in the fourth grade could reach a level of proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level, while students in the ninth grade could reach proficiency in acting appropriate to their grade level. Additionally, theatre standards are written and organized in a way that both theatre and non-theatre educators can access, integrate, and utilize them in a variety of instructional settings.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000308</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MN</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2003-Minnesota-Academic Standards Language Arts.xml</filename><title>Minnesota Academic Standards Language Arts K-12</title><description>The Minnesota Academic Standards in Language Arts are organized by grade level into three general strands: 1) Reading and Literature, 2) Writing, and 3) Speaking, Listening and Viewing.

The revision of the mathematics content standards has developed three Core Standards at each grade from Kindergarten through 8th grade. These Core Standards provide the major concepts that will be the primary focus of teaching and learning at each grade. Underneath each of these Core Standards are from three to nine content standards, which provide the details necessary for curriculum and assessment.

The number of class periods for which theatre is offered will depend upon enrollment and the availability of space for acting, constructing costumes, scenery, and properties. Theatre classes provide opportunities for both individual and group projects. For this reason, students working at two, three, or four different achievement levels may be accommodated in a single class if the enrollment is small.

Dance is a performing art ideally taught sequentially with each level reinforcing and building upon skills taught at previous levels. Dance education is a study of “the art of dance” as well as the techniques involved in the various styles. As students learn and share dances from their own communities and other cultures, they gain skills and knowledge that will prepare them to become responsive participants in an increasingly global society, with a better understanding of dance from a recreational or vocational viewpoint. Each level of dance provides opportunities to correlate dance activities with other subjects thereby enriching learning.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2008</created><docId>D1000310</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>WV</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2008-West Virginia-Music Content Standards.xml</filename><title>21st Century Music Content Standards and Objectives for West Virginia Schools</title><description>Performing, creating, and responding to music are essential parts of the school curriculum because they are fundamental processes in

comprehensive and sequential program of study in music during the school day, including the opportunity to perform and attend
performances. Singing, playing instruments, moving to music, and creating music enables students to acquire musical skills and
knowledge that can be developed in no other way. Learning to read and notate music gives them skills to explore music independently.
Listening to, analyzing, and evaluating music are important building blocks of musical learning. To relate to a diverse, global society,
students must understand historical and cultural heritage.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2008</created><docId>D1000311</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>GA</author><topic>math</topic><filename>Math-2004-Georgia-Mathematics Performance Standards.xml</filename><title>Georgia Mathematics Performance Standards</title><description>The Georgia performance standards for mathematics have been designed to achieve a balance among concepts, skills, and problem solving.

The arts are often asked to express that which cannot be expressed through words. The Priority Academic Student Skills (PASS) suggest benchmarks in the understanding of the arts for all students. Why is it important for each student to understand the significance of the arts in a historical, cultural, or aesthetic sense? Should students be encouraged to create meaningful, interpretive, original, or creative expressions? Will meaningful arts instruction give students the confidence they need to explore and create at the very highest of educational standards? Anthropologists have found evidence of the use of art for purposes of discussion as early as 70,000 years ago. The arts that are created today will one day be our contribution to this ongoing discussion of the human experience.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D10002E6</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>AR</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2003-Arkansas-K-12 ELA Curriculum Framework.xml</filename><title>K-12 English Language Arts Curriculum Framework</title><description>Arkansas' Learning Standards are defined in the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks, discipline-based documents which clearly describe what students must know and be able to do in each academic content area at three critical levels: grades 4, 8, and 12.

Students at every grade level apply similar language skills and concepts to increasingly complex materials. Students build upon and refine their knowledge, gaining sophistication and independence as they grow. Second, although represented separately in the curriculum standards, the content standards are interdependent. Each standard intertwines with and supports the others. Students might at any time read and write, view and discuss, or interpret and perform, in order to understand and communicate meaning. Thus, at all grade levels, effective English language arts curriculum units weave together skills and concepts from several standards and content areas to support student learning.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2001</created><docId>D1000206</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>AL</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2003-Alabama-Language Arts Addendum Reading.xml</filename><title>Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts Addendum: Reading</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D1000028</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>IN</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2000-Indiana-Academic Standards English Language.xml</filename><title>Indiana's Academic Standards 2000 in English/Language Arts</title><description>Children develop at different rates.

The EESK document is organized under three knowledge skills standards (Standards 1-3) and two process skills standards (Standards 4-5) which reflect the breadth of environmental education and its goal of environmental literacy. These skills should be incorporated throughout all sections and activities within the document on a continuing basis. Related benchmarks and indicators suggesting appropriate expectations for learner performance and achievement at specific grade levels (4th, 8th, and 12th grades) follow each standard.

The Sunshine State Standards are divided into five strands categorizing broad areas of knowledge within language arts. This division does not mean that learning should be fragmented. The language arts strands and expectations are interdependent. In fact, several expectations might often be combined in a single teaching or assessment activity. Further, when used effectively, instructional activities will include grade level expectations from other language arts strands and from other subjects. Research indicates that learning is most effective when new information is related to previous knowledge and has some immediate application in the life of the learner.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1996</created><docId>D1000167</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>WA</author><topic>historicalUnderstanding</topic><filename>Historical Understanding-2003-Washington-History EALR.xml</filename><title>History Essential Academic Learning Requirements</title><description>Social studies in Washington State contributes to developing responsible citizens in a culturally diverse, democratic society within an interdependent world.

Social studies recognizes the challenges and benefits of living in a diverse cultural and ideological society. The resulting interactions are contextualized in space and time and have social, political, economic, and geographical dimensions.

Central to each of the visual, performing, and applied arts is the artistic/creative process, i.e. a non-linear process characterized by iterative cycles* of exploration in which students attempt a variety of approaches and sustain a realm of possible results before completion. This process is important to the preparation of all students, throughout life and across careers.  For these reasons, the goal of the visual, performing, and applied arts credit guidelines is to ensure that all students have a foundation and experience in the complete artistic/creative process, and that they achieve competence in this process by the time they graduate from high school.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000396</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>NY</author><topic>socialStudies</topic><filename>Social Studies-1996-New York-Learning Standards Social Studies.xml</filename><title>Learning Standards for Social Studies</title><description>Learning Standards are defined as the knowledge, skills, and understandings that individuals habitually demonstrate over time as a consequence of instruction and experience.

These extended standards are an extension of the Kansas Mathematics Standards. These extended standards, benchmarks, indicators, and examples are intended to be used in developing curricular materials for students with significant cognitive disabilities who are eligible for the alternate assessment. In addition, the extended standards will be helpful in developing IEP goals, benchmarks, or objectives for students with significant cognitive disabilities and who are eligible to take the Kansas Alternate Assessment. These standards are designed for students who require substantial adjustments to the general curriculum, yet allow that curriculum to maintain a clear connection to the general education standards.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000279</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>WA</author><topic>math</topic><filename>Math-2004-Washington-Essential Academic Learning Require.xml</filename><title>Essential Academic Learning Requirements in Mathematics</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D100017D</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MI</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-2006-Michigan-High School ELA Content Standards .xml</filename><title>High School English Language Arts Content Standards and Expectations</title><description>The expectations contained in this document reflect best practices and current research in the teaching and learning of English language, the craft of writing, and literature.

The original mathematics framework, adopted in 2005-06 by the State Board of Education, has not changed and is the foundation from which everything else is developed.  What has been added to the curriculum standards are “grade-level expectations” (GLEs), which further delineate the performance standards and/or expectations in the original framework.

The standards define social studies as the four disciplines of history, geography, civics, and economics. The teaching of social studies should include interdisciplinary connections among these areas. Social studies instruction can be based on one or more of these core disciplines or on a combination of these in the problem-solving or inquiry mode. This is frequently the basis of social studies activities in the classroom. In addition, these standards identify a common core of skills that are integral to the social studies disciplines.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D10002B6</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>NM</author><topic>socialStudies</topic><filename>Social Studies-2001-New Mexico-Social Studies Content Standards.xml</filename><title>Social Studies Content Standards, Benchmarks, and Performance Standards</title><description>New Mexico Social Studies Content Standards, Benchmarks, and Performance Standards identify what students should know and be able to do across all grade levels K-12.

They are not designed to serve as a textbook or the curriculum for a theatre course or courses. These standards provide an outline of expectations for theatre education in the state of Kansas. The four levels (basic, proficient, advanced, and exemplary) loosely correspond to the number of theatre courses a student has taken. Introduction to theatre is recommended at the Pre-K level. However, it is important to realize that in classroom application, the progression of benchmarks may apply over virtually any sequence of grades. Benchmarks at each level build upon those from previous levels, but do not replace them.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D100031E</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>NY</author><topic>english</topic><filename>English-1996-New York-Learning Standards for English Lang.xml</filename><title>Learning Standards for English Language Arts</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1996</created><docId>D100016A</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>MI</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-1998-Michigan-Arts Education Content Standards an.xml</filename><title>Arts Education Content Standards and Benchmarks</title><description>The Arts Education Content Standards and Benchmarks represent rigorous expectations of what all Michigan students should know and be able to do in dance, music, theatre and the visual arts at the elementary, middle and high school levels.

Curriculum documents may take a variety of forms: a district curriculum guide or scope and sequence, a course syllabus, or a unit or lesson plan. Instruction refers to the implementation of the defined curriculum. Assessment should take many forms, including diagnostic and classroom-based formative and summative assessments that measure student proficiency of the defined curriculum.

Those familiar with the national standards should find the Indiana Standards compatible in content and achievement.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D10002FE</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>SD</author><topic>science</topic><filename>Science-1999-South Dakota-Science Standards.xml</filename><title>Science Standards</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1999</created><docId>D1000175</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>OR</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2004-Oregon-Revised Arts Content Standards.xml</filename><title>Revised Arts Content Standards</title><description>The Revised Oregon Arts Content Standards were adopted by the State Board of Education on October 21, 2004, for use in schools during the 2006-07 school year. Changes include editing for greater clarity and consistent terminology, the addition of standards addressing the creative process and interrelationships among art forms, and a greater emphasis on student reflection. Learning in and through the arts prepares students for a life enriched through engagement in the creative process, an appreciation of aesthetics and an understanding of the relationships between the arts and society. Arts literacy enhances a student’s communication, analytical thinking, problem solving and multi-cultural awareness.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2004</created><docId>D10002E8</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>CO</author><topic>historicalUnderstanding</topic><filename>Historical Understanding-1995-Colorado-Historical Understanding Standards .xml</filename><title>Colorado Model Content Standards for History</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>1995</created><docId>D100008B</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>CO</author><topic>civics</topic><filename>Civics-1998-Colorado-Model Content Standards Civics.xml</filename><title>Colorado Model Content Standards for Civics</title><description>The standards outlined in this document summarize the knowledge and skills that are the basis of responsible citizenship.

Geographic reasoning is a way of studying human and natural features within a spatial perspective. Through the study of geography, students will be able to understand local, national, regional, and global issues. Students will interpret the arrangement and interactions of human and physical systems on the surface of the Earth. As these patterns have changed over time and are important to governments and economies, geographic reasoning will enhance students’ understanding of history, civics, and economics.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2006</created><docId>D1000286</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>WA</author><topic>geography</topic><filename>Geography-2003-Washington-Geography EALR.xml</filename><title>Geography Essential Academic Learning Requirements</title><description>Social studies in Washington State contributes to developing responsible citizens in a culturally diverse, democratic society within an interdependent world. Social studies equips learners to make sound judgments and take appropriate actions that will contribute to sustainable development of human society and the physical environment. Social studies comprises the study of relationships among people, and between people and the environment. Social studies recognizes the challenges and benefits of living in a diverse cultural and ideological society. The resulting interactions are contextualized in space and time and have social, political, economic, and geographical dimensions. Based on appropriate investigations and reflections within social studies, students develop distinctive skills and a critical awareness of the human condition and emerging spatial patterns and the processes and events that shape them.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D10002B3</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>DE</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2007-Delaware-Music Content Standards and GLEs.xml</filename><title>Music Content Standards and Grade Level Expectations</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2007</created><docId>D10002DE</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>DE</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-2007-Delaware-Dance Content Standards and GLEs.xml</filename><title>Dance Content Standards and Grade Level Expectations</title><description></description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2007</created><docId>D10002DD</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>GA</author><topic>socialStudies</topic><filename>Social Studies-2008-Georgia-Perf Standards for Social Studies.xml</filename><title>Performance Standards for Social Studies</title><description>The Georgia Performance Standards for Social Studies were designed to develop

As a subject area, social studies may be difficult to define, because it is at once multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Social studies may be taught as a blend of history, geography, civics, economics, and government in one class, perhaps called “social studies,” or it may be taught as a series of separate discipline-based classes, such as “United States History” and “World Geography,” within a social studies department. However it is presented, social studies as a field of study incorporates many disciplines in an integrated fashion, and is designed to promote civic competence. Civic competence is the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required of students to be able to assume “the office of citizen,” as Thomas Jefferson called it.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2003</created><docId>D10002BB</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>IN</author><topic>science</topic><filename>Science-2005-Indiana-Advanced Life Science Foods.xml</filename><title>Indiana's Advanced Life Science Standards:  Foods</title><description>Advanced Life Sciences: Foods is a standards-based, interdisciplinary science course that integrates biology, chemistry, and microbiology in the context of foods and the food industry.

This is accomplished by using the five content areas, as described in chapter two. Though such an organization brings with it the danger of fragmentation, the hope is that the objectives and the test items built on them will, in many cases, cross some of the boundaries of these content areas.
One of the goals of this framework is to provide more clarity and specificity in the objectives for each grade level. To accomplish this, a matrix was created that depicts the particular objectives that are appropriate for assessment under each subtopic. Within Number, for example, and the subtopic of Number Sense, specific objectives are listed for assessment at grade 4 and grade 8. The same objective at different grade levels depicts a developmental sequence for that concept or skill.</description><version>http://purl.org/ASN/export/2.0.0</version><fileCreated>May 14 2009</fileCreated><created>2007</created><docId>D100036A</docId></docInfo><docInfo path="unknown"><author>UT</author><topic>theArts</topic><filename>The Arts-1997-Utah-Utah Fine Arts - Dance.xml</filename><title>Utah Fine Arts - Dance</title><description>Study in the arts is an essential means---not an end---to acquiring thinking skills, creativity, the ability to change, and the facility to teach oneself.
