			Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework
		</title>
		<description>
			The 2006 Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework is the result of the contributions of many educators across the state to the 2001 Framework and, more recently, to the 2006 revision of the high school standards. Because of the broad-based, participatory nature of the revision process, this document cannot reflect all of the professional views of every contributor. It reflects instead a balanced synthesis of their suggestions.

			Colorado Model Content Standards for Science
		</title>
		<description>
			The Colorado model standards presented here specify what all students should know and be able to do in science as a result of their school studies. Specific expectations are given for students completing grades K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. These standards reflect high expectations and outline the essential level of science knowledge and skills needed by all citizens to participate productively in our increasingly technological society. Some suggestions are also offered for those students who elect to extend their study of science beyond that specified in these content standards, based on their particular interests, motivation, career goals, and needs.
