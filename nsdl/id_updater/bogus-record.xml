      <description>All about natural gas</description>
      <subject>Oil isn't the only form of petroleum; Another form of petroleum is natural gas; primarily used; fuel; heat; similar to oil; Under pressure gas acts as a liquid; behaves very similarly underground as oil; where there is oil there is almost always at least some natural gas present; in many cases natural gas and oil come from the same source material; different factors determine whether oil or gas is created; amount of &quot;cooking&quot;; maturation; With just a relatively small amount of heat and pressure natural gas will be produced; With more heat and pressure natural gas will be chemically turned into oil; Another factor in this process is the source of the organic material; Organic material from the ocean, usually the tiny creatures known as diatoms and foraminifera, get turned into oil; Material from land, however, such as dead bits of plants swept into the ocean, generally become natural gas</subject>
